0,0,Land Transaction Tax,Who has to pay," You must pay LTT if you buy a property or land over a certain price threshold in Wales. The threshold is where the tax starts to apply. 
 The current LTT threshold is: 
 
 £225,000 for residential properties (if you do not own other property) 
 £225,000 for non-residential(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-non-residential-mixed-use-property-guide) land and property 
 
 Based on the  LTT rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands)  set by the Welsh Government. 
 There are different rules if you already own one or more residential properties, and you may need to pay the higher residential rates. However, if you’re replacing your main residence, the higher rates may not apply. See our  guide to higher rates(https://www.gov.wales/higher-rates-land-transaction-tax-guide) .

 Each dwelling should be private and secure. That means you should not be able to move freely from one dwelling to the other, for example, through a common hallway. 
 If there are interconnecting doors between the dwellings, they should be lockable on the date you buy the property. 
 Because you’ll be buying more than one dwelling, you’ll need to consider whether you have to pay the  higher rates of LTT(https://www.gov.wales/higher-rates-land-transaction-tax-guide) .

54,54,Land Transaction Tax relief for multiple dwellings,How to calculate tax with the relief," MDR is a partial relief. This means that where it’s claimed, there’ll always be some LTT owed. 
 You can use our  MDR calculator(https://www.gov.wales/calculate-land-transaction-tax-multiple-dwellings-relief)  to help you work out how much you’ll pay with a claim for the relief. 
 Or follow these 3 steps: 
 
 Take the total purchase price for all the dwellings and divide it by the number of dwellings you’ve bought. 
 Take the figure from step 1 and calculate the tax due based on this amount. You can use our  LTT calculator (https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) to help you work this out. 
 Take the figure from step 2 and multiply it by the number of dwellings used in step 1. This gives you the total amount of LTT payable. 
 
 You can also watch our  short explainer videos(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomRz15Bk0zHCb7g5COxqeph-k6lgPTSN)  to find out more about how to work out the tax due. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Mr A buys 2 neighbouring dwellings for £400,000 on the same day from the same seller. The higher rates of LTT(https://www.gov.wales/higher-rates-land-transaction-tax-guide) apply to this transaction. 
 The amount of LTT he owes applying MDR would calculate as follows: 
 
 400,000 / 2 = £200,000 
 £200,000 at the higher rates of LTT(https://www.gov.wales/higher-rates-land-transaction-tax-guide) = £8,700 
 £8,700 x 2 = £17,400

55,55,Land Transaction Tax relief for multiple dwellings,Minimum tax rule," Where you claim MDR you must pay at least 1% of the purchase price of the property in LTT. 
 This means if you follow the above 3 steps to calculate and get a figure of less than 1% of the property’s purchase price, you’ll need to uplift the amount on your return to 1% of the purchase price. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Ms C buys 2 dwellings in one transaction. The purchase price was £270,000. The dwellings have individual values of £190,000 and £80,000. The conditions for  subsidiary dwelling exception(https://gov.wales/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#section-5219)  in the higher rates residential property transactions rules are met. So higher rates will not apply to the transaction. 
 Using the above steps to calculate, the LTT liability would equal £0. But the minimum tax rule will apply in this case as the LTT on the consideration given is less than 1% of that amount of consideration. 
 The minimum tax rule therefore means that the tax to be self-assessed is £2,700 (£270,000 x 1%).

114,114,Land Transaction Tax: differences to Stamp Duty Land Tax, ," This list is not a complete statement of the differences between LTT and SDLT. 
 You must check the relevant detailed guidance and legislation for LTT when you're involved with a land transaction in Wales from 1 April 2018. 
 
 The main differences between LTT and SDLT 
 
 
   
 LTT 
 SDLT 
 
 
 
 
 Rates and bands 
 
 The Welsh Government sets the  rates and bands for LTT(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) . 
 To calculate how much LTT to pay use our  tax calculator(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) . 
 
 
 The UK government sets the rates and bands for SDLT. 
 To calculate how much SDLT to pay use  HMRC’s tax calculator(https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/calculate-stamp-duty-land-tax/)(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) . 
 
 
 
 
 Higher rates: intermediate transaction(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5249) rule 
 
 
 The purchase of a new main residence will not be chargeable to LTT at the higher rate if a previous main residence was disposed of. 
 However, if the seller purchases another property (for example buy-to-let) before completion of the purchase of a new main residence, the seller may be required to ‘look back’ to that  intermediate transaction(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5249)  and pay the higher rates. 
 
 SDLT does not apply an interim transaction rule. 
 
 
 Meaning of residential and non-residential 
 LTT has its own  specific interpretation guidance(https://gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-interpretation-provisions-technical-guidance#6418) . 
 SDLT also has its own specific interpretation guidance(https://gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-interpretation-provisions-technical-guidance#6418), found on the HMRC website. 
 
 
 Residential leases 
 
 LTT is only payable on any premium (or other consideration) that does not consist of rent. 
 Rent figures are not required when completing a return for a new  residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance) . 
 
 SDLT is charged on both rent and any premium (or other consideration) for a new residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance). 
 
 
 Non-residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance)s: relevant rent rule 
 
 The 0% band for premiums (and other non-rent consideration) extends to £150,000. 
 This band can increase to 1% where the ‘relevant rent’ exceeds £13,500. 
 Relevant rent(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6818)  is usually the highest rent payable in any year across the entire term of the lease. 
 
 SDLT does not apply a relevant rent rule. 
 
 
 Reliefs 
 
 First-time buyer relief is not available. 
 The 0% band currently applies to purchases up to £225,000. 
 
 
 First-time buyer relief is available. 
 The 0% band currently applies to purchases up to £250,000, or £425,000 for first time buyers. 
 
 
 
 Avoidance and compliance 
 
 There's an anti-avoidance rule that applies to all LTT reliefs. 
 The general anti-avoidance rule allows the WRA to counter any artificial tax avoidance arrangement. 
 
 
 There are rules that target specific aspects of particular reliefs. 
 The Sections 75A-C Finance Act 2003 anti-avoidance rules apply. 
 
 
 
 Deferral of tax 
 A taxpayer must supply an expected end date of the  deferral(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5577)  and where one cannot be predicted use the 5th anniversary of the transaction. 
 The taxpayer need not supply an expected end date of a deferral(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5577) period.

117,117,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5010 Companies," (section 33) 
 A company is defined as any body corporate or unincorporated association. It does not extend to partnerships or limited liability partnerships except as otherwise provided, for example, for group relief purposes a body corporate does include a limited liability partnership. 
 All actions of a company for the purposes of LTT (including actions required by TCMA where these actions  relate to land transactions) must be done through the proper officer of the company (usually the company secretary) or another person, normally an officer, authorised by the company to act on the company’s behalf in relation to its LTT affairs. That authority can be; express, implied, or apparent. 
 It should be this person that authorises the submission of the LTT return or amended return or who signs the declaration in a land transaction return or amended return. 
 In practice, an electronic return should be accepted as having been authorised for submission by a proper officer or person with the appropriate authority. Similarly, a paper return or amended return should be accepted provided that it contains a signature and there is no reason to doubt the authority of the person signing. 
 On this basis, the signature of any company official or employee can be accepted. This includes a member of an in-house legal team. 
 The treasurer or acting treasurer should normally sign a land transaction return or amended return from an unincorporated association. 
 Company in liquidation or administration 
 When a company is in liquidation or administration, different rules apply. The liquidator or administrator, as the case may be, must sign any returns or amended returns. 
 Special rules for companies 
 There are certain rules that apply specifically to transactions where the company is buyer: 
 
 deemed market value rules, and  
 exceptions to the deemed market value rule.

118,118,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5020 Unit trust schemes," (section 34) 
 When a unit trust scheme acquires land, the trustees of a unit trust scheme are treated as if they were a company for the purposes of filing returns and paying LTT. 
 However, certain rules that apply to companies do not apply to unit trust schemes and certain reliefs that may be claimed by companies cannot be claimed by a unit trust scheme:  
 
 the deemed market value rule, and 
 group relief, reconstruction and acquisition reliefs. 
 
 The rights of unit holders are treated as if they are shares in the company. Therefore the issue, surrender and transfer of units within the scheme are not within the scope of LTT. 
 A unit trust scheme has the same meaning as in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (see section 237 especially) and a unit holder means a person who is a participant in the unit trust scheme and is therefore entitled to a share of the investments subject to the trusts of a unit trust scheme. 
 An umbrella scheme is a unit trust scheme which has arrangements for separate pooling of the contributions of participants and the profits or income out of which payments are to be made and under which the participants are entitled to exchange rights in one pool for rights in another. A part of an umbrella scheme means such of the arrangements as relate to a separate pool. 
 Where there is an umbrella scheme each part is regarded as a separate unit trust and the scheme as a whole is not treated as a unit trust scheme for LTT purposes. Therefore, where a separate pool of an umbrella scheme acquires land, that pool is treated as a unit trust scheme in its own right and the trustees of that part will be treated as a company. Therefore, where one pool of an umbrella scheme transfers land to another pool of the same umbrella scheme a land transaction has occurred for LTT purposes and a return must be made if the transaction is notifiable. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/application-ltta-and-tcma-certain-persons-and-bodies
119,119,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5030 Open-ended investment companies," (section 35) 
 Open-ended investment companies (‘OEICs’) are bodies corporate and companies. They are therefore treated in the same way as any other company for the purposes of LTT. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/application-ltta-and-tcma-certain-persons-and-bodies
120,120,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5040 Co-ownership authorised contractual schemes," (section 36) 
 When a co-ownership authorised contractual scheme (‘CoACS’) acquires land, the scheme is treated as if it was a company for the purposes of filing returns and paying LTT.   
 A CoACS means a ‘co-ownership scheme’ which is authorised for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 by an authorisation order under section 261D of that Act. A ‘co-ownership scheme’ has the same meaning as in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (see section 235A of the Act). 
 However, certain rules that apply to companies do not apply to CoACS and certain reliefs that may be claimed by companies cannot be claimed by a CoACS: 
 
 the deemed market value rule, and 
 group relief, reconstruction and acquisition reliefs. 
 
 The rights of the participants in the CoACS are treated as if they are shares in the company. Therefore the issue, surrender and transfer of participants interests within the scheme are not within the scope of LTT. 
 A CoACS is a collective investment scheme which is: 
 
 constituted under the law of an EEA state (other than the UK) by a contract 
 is managed by a body corporate incorporated under the law of an EEA state, and  
 is authorised under the law of an EEA state in a manner that complies with the definition of a CoACS. 
 
 An umbrella CoACS is a scheme which has arrangements for separate pooling of the contributions of participants and the profits or income out of which payments are to be made and under which the participants are entitled to exchange rights in one pool for rights in another. A sub-scheme of an umbrella scheme means such of the arrangements as relate to a separate pool. 
 Where there is an umbrella scheme each sub-scheme is regarded as a separate CoACS and the scheme as a whole is not treated as a single CoACS for LTT purposes. Therefore, where a sub-scheme of an umbrella scheme acquires land, that sub-scheme is treated as a CoACs in its own right and the operator is required to make any returns, etc. Therefore, where one pool of an umbrella scheme transfers land to another pool of the same umbrella scheme a land transaction has occurred for LTT purposes and a return must be made if the transaction is notifiable. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/application-ltta-and-tcma-certain-persons-and-bodies
121,121,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5050 Joint buyers: General rules," (section 37) 
 The rules apply to a land transaction where there are two or more buyers who are or will be jointly entitled to the interest acquired. The rules in relation to joint buyers apply to partnerships or trustees, subject to any special provisions relating to such partnerships and trustees. 
 Any obligation imposed on a buyer is generally imposed on the buyers jointly but may be discharged by any one of them (the requirements in relation to the return and the declaration are examples where this general rule does not apply. 
 Anything required or authorised by the LTT regime or required under the TCMA to be done in relation to the buyers must be done in relation to all of them. 
 Any liability of a buyer is joint and several, so a failure to submit a land transaction return and pay the tax due will attract interest and penalties which can be recovered from all or any of the joint buyers. This is despite any agreement between the individual joint buyers as to the payment of LTT or individual responsibility for the failure to comply with obligations under the LTTA or TCMA. 
 Joint buyers: returns and declarations 
 (section 38) 
 If the transaction is a notifiable transaction, a single land transaction return is required and the declaration that the land transaction return is complete and correct must be made by all the buyers. 
 Joint buyers: enquiries and assessments 
 (section 39) 
 When the WRA issues an enquiry notice into a return it must issue that notice to all joint buyers known to it. 
 When the WRA issues the notices requiring documents and information from a taxpayer during the course of an enquiry, they can be issued to individual buyers in relation to the land transaction entered into by that individual buyer when one of a number of joint buyers. 
 When the WRA issues a closure notice into a return, it must issue that notice to all joint buyers known to it. 
 Any one of the joint buyers may ask for a direction that a closure notice is issued. However, on such an application, all of the joint buyers are entitled to be a party to that application. 
 A WRA determination must be made by the WRA in the name of all the joint buyers known to it, and is not valid if this is not done. However, if there are more buyers than those identified in the determination the absence of those people does not make the determination invalid, if they were unknown to the WRA at the time of making the determination. 
 Similarly, a WRA assessment must be made by WRA in the name of all the joint buyers known to it, and is not valid if this is not done. Again, if there are more buyers than those identified in the assessment the absence of those people does not make the assessment invalid, if they were unknown to the WRA at the time of making the determination. 
 Joint buyers: appeals and reviews 
 (section 40) 
 If an appealable decision is made by the WRA, a request for a review or an appeal may be made by any of the buyers but can only be settled with the agreement of all the buyers and a decision binds them all. 
 Where a review is undertaken by WRA as a result of a request for review of an appealable decision by one or more of the buyers, but not by all of the buyers, the WRA must: 
 
 issue a notice of the review to each of the buyers who did not make the request for a review. This is important so that all the buyers are aware of the review. 
 allow any of those buyers who did not make the request for the review be a party to the review if they notify WRA that they wish to be such a party.   
 issue the notice of the WRA’s conclusions to each buyer whose identity is known to the WRA. 
 
 The effect of the WRA‘s conclusions of a review apply to all buyers. 
 Where an appeal against an appealable decision is made to the tribunal by one or more of the buyers but not all of them, the WRA must: 
 
 issue a notice of appeal to each of the buyers who did not make the appeal. This is important so that all the buyers are aware of the appeal. 
 
 Any of those buyers who did not make the appeal are entitled to be parties to the appeal, and the tribunal’s decision applies to all buyers. 
 Finally, a settlement agreement can only be reached with all buyers. Therefore if one buyer is not prepared to enter into the settlement agreement, the matter will need to be finalised through the appeal process. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/application-ltta-and-tcma-certain-persons-and-bodies
122,122,Application of LTTA and TCMA to certain persons and bodies,LTTA/5060 Persons acting in a representative capacity," (section 43) 
 A person may act in a representative capacity to perform functions, including making returns and dealing with correspondence.    
 Personal representatives 
 The personal representatives of a person who is the purchaser under a land transaction are responsible for discharging the obligations of the purchaser in relation to the transaction. They may deduct any payment made by them in respect of LTT or amounts charged for interest and penalties out of the assets and effects of the deceased person. 
 Receiver appointed by a UK court 
 Such a receiver having direction and control of any property is responsible for discharging any obligations in relation to a transaction affecting that property, as if the property were not under the direction and control of the court. 
 Parent or guardian of a minor 
 A minor cannot make the declaration on a tax return nor represent themselves in other matters with the WRA (enquiries etc.). Therefore a parent or guardian is responsible for discharging any obligations of the minor that are not discharged by the minor themselves (for example payment of the tax).

147,147,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Overview / Land Transaction Tax differences to SDLT, ," This list is not a complete statement of the differences between LTT and SDLT. 
 You must check the relevant detailed guidance and legislation for LTT when you're involved with a land transaction in Wales from 1 April 2018. 
 
 The main differences between LTT and SDLT 
 
 
   
 LTT 
 SDLT 
 
 
 
 
 Rates and bands 
 
 The Welsh Government sets the  rates and bands for LTT(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) . 
 To calculate how much LTT to pay use our  tax calculator(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) . 
 
 
 The UK government sets the rates and bands for SDLT. 
 To calculate how much SDLT to pay use  HMRC’s tax calculator(https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/calculate-stamp-duty-land-tax/)(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) . 
 
 
 
 
 Higher rates: intermediate transaction(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5249) rule 
 
 
 The purchase of a new main residence will not be chargeable to LTT at the higher rate if a previous main residence was disposed of. 
 However, if the seller purchases another property (for example buy-to-let) before completion of the purchase of a new main residence, the seller may be required to ‘look back’ to that  intermediate transaction(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5249)  and pay the higher rates. 
 
 SDLT does not apply an interim transaction rule. 
 
 
 Meaning of residential and non-residential 
 LTT has its own  specific interpretation guidance(https://gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-interpretation-provisions-technical-guidance#6418) . 
 SDLT also has its own specific interpretation guidance(https://gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-interpretation-provisions-technical-guidance#6418), found on the HMRC website. 
 
 
 Residential leases 
 
 LTT is only payable on any premium (or other consideration) that does not consist of rent. 
 Rent figures are not required when completing a return for a new  residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance) . 
 
 SDLT is charged on both rent and any premium (or other consideration) for a new residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance). 
 
 
 Non-residential lease(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance)s: relevant rent rule 
 
 The 0% band for premiums (and other non-rent consideration) extends to £150,000. 
 This band can increase to 1% where the ‘relevant rent’ exceeds £13,500. 
 Relevant rent(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6818)  is usually the highest rent payable in any year across the entire term of the lease. 
 
 SDLT does not apply a relevant rent rule. 
 
 
 Reliefs 
 
 First-time buyer relief is not available. 
 The 0% band currently applies to purchases up to £225,000. 
 
 
 First-time buyer relief is available. 
 The 0% band currently applies to purchases up to £250,000, or £425,000 for first time buyers. 
 
 
 
 Avoidance and compliance 
 
 There's an anti-avoidance rule that applies to all LTT reliefs. 
 The general anti-avoidance rule allows the WRA to counter any artificial tax avoidance arrangement. 
 
 
 There are rules that target specific aspects of particular reliefs. 
 The Sections 75A-C Finance Act 2003 anti-avoidance rules apply. 
 
 
 
 Deferral of tax 
 A taxpayer must supply an expected end date of the  deferral(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5577)  and where one cannot be predicted use the 5th anniversary of the transaction. 
 The taxpayer need not supply an expected end date of a deferral(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5577) period.

229,229,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8030 Major interest," Schedule 5 to LTTA provides that a transaction is a higher rates transaction where the main subject-matter of the transaction consists of a major interest in a dwelling. In turn, a major interest is defined (at section 68) as being an estate in fee simple absolute (freehold) or a term of years absolute (leasehold) subsisting at law or in equity (although leases granted for a term of less than 7 years are exempted). Where land is held in Wales, the legal interest in the land is separated from the beneficial interest, which is also known as the economic benefit of the property. In order to be a higher rates residential property transaction sub-paragraphs 3(2), 11(2) and 20(1) of Schedule 5 provide that the main subject-matter of that transaction must consist of a major interest. Not every transaction involving the transfer of a beneficial interest in residential property would be a transaction, the main subject-matter of which consists of a major interest (except as provided for in the Act for the purposes of the Act). The vast majority of transactions involving residential dwellings are likely to involve the transfer of both the legal and beneficial interests. However, the legal ownership is separate from the beneficial ownership and the legal owner or owners will not necessarily be the same as the beneficial owner or owners. The legal owner holds the beneficial interest in the property on trust for the beneficial owner. The beneficial owner will have a right to the income from the property or a share in it, and a right to the proceeds of sale of the property or part of the proceeds. The value therefore lies in the beneficial interest. Where a property is purchased in joint names there is a trust of land. In such cases the buyers hold the legal estate as joint tenants and hold the beneficial interest in the property as either joint tenants or tenants in common. Joint tenants are entitled to an equal share of the property. A key feature of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship which means that upon the death of one co-owner, that co-owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving co-owner by law. Tenants in common hold the property in either equal or unequal shares which are known as undivided shares. An undivided share may be transferred to a third party. A transaction effecting the transfer of an undivided share may also involve a change in ownership of the legal estate, or it could relate to the beneficial interest alone. Due to the possibility of beneficial interests being transferred separately from the legal interest, the policy intention is that transactions involving such transfers should be caught by the higher rates provisions, if the other conditions apply. Jointly owned property (Paragraphs 5(3)-(6) and 15(3)-(6))   Where a transaction meets the various conditions set out in Schedule 5, it is a higher rates transaction. One of these conditions is that a buyer who is an individual already has a major interest in another dwelling. Paragraphs 5 and 15 of Schedule 5 refer to the buyer having a major interest in another dwelling, and that interest having a market value of £40,000 or more. The buyer may hold that other dwelling jointly with another person. This provides that when assessing whether this condition is met, the market value of the interest in the other dwelling is based on the buyer’s individual beneficial interest (as a proportion of the total value of the dwelling) rather than being based on the whole of the major interest. Where the buyer is married or in a civil partnership, their interest will be combined with that of their spouse or civil partner to assess whether the £40,000 threshold has been met unless they are no longer living together (as defined by paragraph 25(3) of Schedule 5 LTTA) at the effective date of the transaction concerned. Deeming provisions (paragraph 29) The deeming provisions in paragraphs 27 and 28 of Schedule 5 to LTTA apply in respect of certain settlements which entitle the beneficiary to occupy the dwelling for life or to income earned in respect of the dwelling, and also in respect of bare trusts involving leaseholds. The effect of these deeming provisions is that it is the beneficiary rather than the trustee who is treated as the buyer (or as holding, or disposing of, an interest in a dwelling). The deeming provisions mean that it is necessary to look through the trust (be that a bare trust or the specific type of settlement trust specified in the paragraph above) to the beneficiary to determine whether the higher rates apply. This ensures that the right person is liable for the tax (i.e. the person who has the economic benefit of the property). The aim of these rules is to put it beyond doubt that residential transactions involving the types of beneficial interest mentioned above will be caught by the higher rates provisions, even where there is no change in the owners of the legal estate. These rules treat the subject matter of that type of transaction as one consisting of a major interest where, immediately prior to the transaction, the seller was deemed to own a major interest by virtue of the deeming provisions, and immediately after the transaction, the buyer is likewise deemed to own the major interest. This will mean, for example, that where a person acquires only an undivided share in a dwelling (under a tenants in common arrangement), but the legal owners and other tenants in common retain their interest in the dwelling, then the acquisition will still be treated as an acquisition of a major interest. It will be subject to the higher rates (provided the other conditions are met). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Mr A owns a number of buy-to-let dwellings with Mr B. Mr A is the legal owner of the properties with Mr A and Mr B owning the beneficial interest as tenants in common (in equal shares). Mr B wishes to dispose of his interest in one of the dwellings (dwelling Y) and Ms C is willing to purchase the 50% beneficial interest in the dwelling (for £50,000). Ms C already owns a number of buy to let dwellings with each having a market value of greater than £40,000 on the effective date of the acquisition of Mr B’s beneficial interest in dwelling Y. The legal ownership of dwelling Y is unchanged and remains solely in Mr A’s name. Ms C is liable to the higher rates on the acquisition of the beneficial interest in dwelling Y because all the relevant conditions have been met and Ms C is deemed to own a major interest in the dwelling following her acquisition of her interest in the dwelling held as a tenant in common.

 Interest acquired is a lease originally granted for less than 7 years (paragraph 37 Schedule 5) A leasehold estate that did not exceed 7 years on the date it was granted is not a major interest, for the purposes of the application of the higher rates of LTT. Major interest acquired is subject to a lease (paragraphs 3, 13 and 20 Schedule 5) A major interest in a dwelling will not be liable for the higher rates where the interest acquired is subject to a lease that has an unexpired term of more than 21 years, and is not held by a person connected to the buyer of the reversionary interest. The facts in relation to the lease are to be considered at the end of the day of the effective date of the acquisition of the reversionary interest.

230,230,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8040 How to establish the value of a beneficial interest in another dwelling," (paragraphs 5 and 15 Schedule 5) The rules for establishing if a beneficial interest in another dwelling is worth £40,000 or more, differ depending upon whether the beneficial interest in the dwelling is owned as joint tenants, or as tenants in common. A married couple, or those in a civil partnership, have their interests, whether as joint tenants or tenants in common, combined to establish the value of the beneficial interest in the other dwelling unless they are not living together at the effective date of the transaction being considered for higher rates liability. For joint tenants, the market value of the currently owned dwelling, at the date of the acquisition of the new dwelling, is divided by the number of joint tenants.

The holiday home is owned by the grandchildren as joint tenants. It has a market value of £200,000. Miss B’s beneficial interest in the holiday home is £25,000 (£200,000/8). As her interest in the holiday home is worth less than £40,000 her acquisition of her main residence is not liable to the higher rates and will be assessed to the main rates and bands(/node/5411).

This is because her civil partner’s interest is treated as hers for the purposes of establishing liability to the higher rates. She is therefore liable to the higher rates on the purchase. If the 2 women had not been in a civil partnership then Ms C’s beneficial interest in her current home would be £37,500 (£75,000/2) and she would not have been liable to higher rates on the purchase of her buy to let property.

231,231,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8050 Definition of dwelling for higher rates purposes," (paragraphs 35 and 36 Schedule 5) A dwelling for the purposes of LTTA is residential property comprising a single dwelling. A dwelling includes dwellings both in Wales and elsewhere in the world. Where the dwelling is not in England and Wales then a number of land law concepts that exist in the law of England and Wales are taken to be the equivalent in those other countries. Similarly, the rules relating to dwellings owned by or on behalf of a minor child outside Wales, apply in the same way as they do in Wales, including in relation to the equivalent to court appointed deputies in those countries. A dwelling for the purposes of the higher rates is a building or part of a building that is: used or suitable for use as a dwelling, or in the process of being constructed or adapted for use as a dwelling (which will include dwellings bought off plan) Suitable for use as a dwelling is a question of fact, and consideration as to whether the residents can live independently of the residents elsewhere in the building, separate and private access to the areas of occupation etc. will be important in considering this matter. In a house of multiple occupation, the absence of a private kitchen or private bathroom will be indicative that the house as a whole is a dwelling rather than the individual rooms within that house each representing a separate dwelling. A dwelling for the purposes of the higher rates will include holiday homes and properties let as furnished holiday lettings (including those that have restricted occupation which prevent the dwelling from being occupied all year round, and properties such as holiday park lodges). The garden or grounds and any buildings on the garden or grounds are part of the dwelling, to the extent they are considered to be residential property for the purposes of LTTA, and the consideration given for these will also be liable to the higher rates. However, where the buildings in the garden or grounds (or a separate flat, for example a basement flat in a house) are themselves also dwellings, the buyer will be acquiring more than one dwelling as a result of their purchase and the higher rates of LTT will be payable. Where the additional dwellings meet the conditions of the subsidiary dwellings rules then the higher rates will not apply. Where a taxpayer acquires residential land that does not include a dwelling (for example a part of a garden) then the higher rates will not apply as the transaction does not include the purchase of a dwelling. The main subject-matter of a transaction will also be an interest in a dwelling (such as off plan purchases) if: there is substantial performance of a contract the main subject-matter includes an interest in a building or part of a building that is being constructed or adapted under the contract for use as a dwelling, and construction or adaptation has not begun by the time the contract is substantially performed If non-residential land is owned on which the taxpayer is seeking, or has obtained, planning permission to convert to residential, that major interest in the land is not treated as an interest in a dwelling until construction or adaptation actually commences. The seeking or obtaining of planning permission falls short of the process of construction or adaptation for use as a dwelling. However, in the event that such a property was sold once construction or adaptation has commenced, if the other conditions for LTT higher rates to apply to the transaction are present, the acquisition by the buyer would be liable to the LTT higher rates. A dwelling for the higher rates of LTT does not include interests held in or acquisitions of caravans, houseboats and mobile homes. LTT in its definition of a residential property, defines certain buildings as being residential (for example residential accommodation for school children) and certain buildings as not being used as a dwelling (for example a prison). For the purposes of the LTT higher rates rules, none of the buildings listed are subject to the higher rates.

232,232,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8060 Exclusions to the higher rates," The higher rates of LTT do not relate to: transactions where the consideration given for the acquisition of the interest is less than £40,000 non-residential or mixed use transactions subsidiary dwellings when specific conditions are met replacement of a main residence when specific conditions are met Interests acquired in the same main residence where the conditions are met retaining interests in former matrimonial home following divorce or dissolution of civil partnership purchase by court appointed deputy for minor child transactions where, in certain circumstances, the interest acquired is subject to a lease with an unexpired term of more than 21 years to someone other than a connected person Attempts to artificially circumvent the application of the higher rates of LTT, may be challenged by the WRA through the application of the General Anti-avoidance Rule (GAAR).

233,233,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8070 Non-residential and mixed transactions," Where a taxpayer acquires a major interest in, 6 or more dwellings in a single transaction, the taxpayer has the option to treat the transaction as a non-residential transaction. If the taxpayer opts for this treatment then the non-residential rates of LTT are used to calculate the taxpayer’s liability. Alternatively they could treat the transaction as residential and, if a claim is made, apply the rules for multiple dwellings relief. If this option is followed then the LTT higher rates are used to calculate the liability. Where a taxpayer enters into a mixed-use transaction, for example a farm or a shop with a flat above, the non-residential rates of tax will apply to the transaction. It is important to note that whilst the acquisition of the property may be taxed at non-residential rates, that tax treatment does not make the dwellings non-residential property when the interests in dwellings a taxpayer holds must be considered for future transactions. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A acquire a chip shop with a flat above on 1 June 2020. Prior to the acquisition, they own no other property. The transaction is a mixed-use transaction and therefore the non-residential rates of tax apply to the acquisition. 3 years later Mr and Mrs A acquire a house costing £150,000 to use as their main residence. They choose to leave the flat above the chip shop (which has a market value of £70,000) empty. They are liable to the LTT higher rates on the acquisition of the house, as at the time of that acquisition, they own a major interest in a dwelling with a value of greater than £40,000 (the flat above the chip shop) and are not replacing their only or main residence.

234,234,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8080 Subsidiary dwelling exception," (paragraph 14 Schedule 5) Where: an individual, or group of individuals, buys more than 1 dwelling to replace their main residence, or; an individual, or group of individuals, buys more than 1 dwelling and they do not own any other interests in dwellings higher rates may not apply to the transaction where: the additional dwelling or dwellings are within the same building or in the grounds of the other dwelling (the “main dwelling”), and the amount of consideration given, based on a just and reasonable apportionment for the main dwelling is more than or equal to 2 thirds of the total consideration given These additional dwellings are called subsidiary dwellings. And where the conditions are met, the transactions benefit from the subsidiary dwelling exception and should be taxed at the main residential rates. In most cases, the valuation of the main dwelling should include all the garden and grounds, and any outbuildings (not including the subsidiary dwelling(s)). There may be cases where as a matter of fact part of the garden or grounds clearly exist solely for the benefit of the subsidiary dwelling. In these cases, the taxpayer should exclude that part of land from the valuation of the main dwelling. This subsidiary dwelling exception can also apply where there is more than 1 additional dwelling. Where: the transaction includes 2 or more additional dwellings that are within the same building or in the grounds of the main dwelling, and; the consideration on a just and reasonable apportionment for the main dwelling is more than or equal to 2 thirds of the total consideration given The subsidiary dwelling exception will apply and the transactions should be taxed at the main residential rates. The subsidiary dwelling must be a dwelling in its own right on the effective date of the transaction. This means that it should be able to support somebody living independently of the main dwelling. The dwelling must be private and secure. To decide whether a property contains one or more dwellings, a number of factors should be taken into account. The following factors are indicative of whether something is a dwelling or suitable for use as a dwelling in its own right. There is no single factor that outweighs the others; they should all be taken into account. The factors should be applied to the property as it is/was on the effective date of the transaction. A toilet and washing facilities. Each dwelling should contain a toilet, sink (other than the kitchen sink) and bath or shower.   Accommodation for both ‘living’ and sleeping. In each dwelling, there should be space for a bed, somewhere to sit and somewhere to eat.   The facility to store, prepare and cook food, as well as ‘wash up’ Each dwelling should contain a kitchen that would normally include an oven and/or hob, hot and cold running water, a space to prepare food (for example a counter top) and a space to store food.   Independent access to both dwellings. If the subsidiary dwelling is in the same building as the main dwelling, a door directly to the outside is not necessarily required; the property may be entered via a communal hallway/landing area. If, however, access is through the living area of the main dwelling, then it is unlikely to be classed as a subsidiary dwelling.   If it is possible to access the subsidiary dwelling from the main dwelling (and vice-versa) there should be a lockable door in place.   The occupant should be able to have some control over the supply of utility services. Where the 2 parts of the property have independent controls over utilities (including electrical consumer unit, stopcock, gas/oil isolation valve, thermostat), this suggests that each part may be a separate dwelling in its own right. However, the absence of these facilities does not necessarily indicate a single dwelling. These tests should be applied to the entire property, not just to the subsidiary dwelling. For example, where works have been undertaken on a single house to create an annex, but the only kitchen in the building is within the annex, this is unlikely to be viewed as a main dwelling and a subsidiary dwelling, but rather a single dwelling. The same will be true where access to the annex is via a communal hallway which is also used by the occupants of the main dwelling to move from one room to another in the main dwelling. The property in Figure A (below) has a communal entrance from which 2 separate parts of the property can be accessed. This is more likely to mean the property comprises of 2 dwellings. However, in Figure B (below) there is a hallway from which a number of rooms can be accessed and it is necessary to use the hallway to move between the living quarters of part of the property. This is less likely to mean that the property is split into 2 separate dwellings. Removing  fixtures(/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance#12827)  alone is unlikely to make the property unsuitable for use as a dwelling. In most circumstances, the pipework and circuitry will remain, meaning that the items could easily be re-installed. The presence of planning permission for an annexe or similar is indicative of there being more than one dwelling on the property. In addition, disaggregation for Council Tax Purposes is indicative of the property comprising of more than one dwelling.  
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A buy a terraced house that has a basement flat. The purchase price is £300,000. They own no other residential property. The amount of money paid, apportioned on a just and reasonable basis, for the maisonette is £225,000. This represents 75% of the purchase price (which is more than 2 thirds of the total consideration). The basement flat is a subsidiary dwelling. This means that the higher rates do not apply to the transaction. Mr and Mrs A may also choose to make a claim to multiple dwelling relief and calculate their liability according to those rules.

The amount of money paid for the main dwelling, based on a just and reasonable apportionment of the total purchase price given is £400,000. This is more than 1 third of the total consideration. This transaction will therefore be subject to the higher rates. However, it is acceptable for the purchase to be structured so that the main dwelling is purchased in 1 land transaction and the holiday letting properties in a separate later linked transaction. The main dwelling will be taxable at the main LTT rates and the 3 cottages at the higher rates. Mr C may choose to make a claim to multiple dwelling relief and calculate his liability according to those rules. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 Miss D buys property which comprises of a country house set in grounds, with several tied cottages within those grounds. The tied cottages each have a walled garden which is for the benefit of those cottages. In valuing the main dwelling when establishing whether the subsidiary dwelling exception may apply, the taxpayer should not include the gardens of each of the cottages, in their valuation. Where the cottages are not set within the grounds of the main dwelling then it is unlikely that they will be viewed as being subsidiary to the main dwelling.

The dwellings are a 4-bedroomed main dwelling and 3 one-bedroom cottages. He pays a total of £700,000 for the properties. The amount of money paid for the main dwelling, based on a just and reasonable apportionment of the total purchase price given is £400,000. This is more than 1 third of the total consideration. This transaction will therefore be subject to the higher rates. However, it is acceptable for the purchase to be structured so that the main dwelling is purchased in 1 land transaction and the holiday letting properties in a separate later linked transaction. The main dwelling will be taxable at the main LTT rates and the 3 cottages at the higher rates. Mr C may choose to make a claim to multiple dwelling relief and calculate his liability according to those rules. 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 Miss D buys property which comprises of a country house set in grounds, with several tied cottages within those grounds. The tied cottages each have a walled garden which is for the benefit of those cottages. In valuing the main dwelling when establishing whether the subsidiary dwelling exception may apply, the taxpayer should not include the gardens of each of the cottages, in their valuation. Where the cottages are not set within the grounds of the main dwelling then it is unlikely that they will be viewed as being subsidiary to the main dwelling.

235,235,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8090 Replacement of main residence," (paragraphs 8 and 17 Schedule 5) A taxpayer who sells their main residence and replaces it with a new only or main residence (‘main residence’) either within 36 months before the sale of the former main residence, or within 36 months after the main residence is sold, may pay the main rates on the transaction rather than the higher rates.  To qualify for this exception, the sold property must have been the taxpayer’s only or main residence at any time in the period of 3 years before the effective date of the transaction (the purchase of the replacement main residence).  In respect of transactions where the main residence is disposed of within the period of 36 months after the replacement is acquired, the taxpayer must apply the higher rates rules to the transaction on the effective date of the relevant transaction and pay the higher rates of LTT. In the event that the relevant conditions for the replacement of main residence are met, the taxpayer may claim a repayment where necessary. The rules relating to the replacement of a main residence apply only to those transactions made by an individual or individuals and not to those made by companies or other non-natural persons, or by individuals and companies or other non-natural persons jointly.

236,236,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8091 Higher rates and linked transactions," This section of guidance describes how the higher rate provisions interact with linked transactions. Replacement of main residence and linked transactions The replacement of a main residence exception rules apply in the scenario where: a taxpayer has purchased 2 or more dwellings as part of a number of linked transactions (see  LTTA/2040(/land-transactions#5054) ) one of those dwellings replaces the taxpayers’ current main residence, and the dwelling which is to replace the taxpayers’ current main residence was purchased in a separate transaction from the other dwellings Where one of the linked transactions involves the purchase of a replacement main residence and meets the criteria set out in  LTTA/8090(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5225)(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5225)(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5225) , the taxpayer is able to apply the exception to that transaction. This means that the main residential rates of tax apply to that transaction. The higher rates apply to the remaining dwelling transaction(s) in the usual way. As the transactions are linked and one of the transactions is at main rates, and the other(s) at higher rates, to calculate the tax the taxpayer should follow a computation method which will result in an apportionment of the total consideration for all of the transactions between main rates and higher rates. The computation method can be found below. The calculation only applies where the replacement main residence is purchased in a separate linked transaction to the other dwellings being purchased. Where the replacement main residence is purchased in the same transaction as 1 or more other dwellings, the conditions at  LTTA/8020(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#3581)(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#3581)  for buying 2 or more dwellings apply. Purchasing 2 or more dwellings where the taxpayer doesn’t have a pre-existing main residence Where a taxpayer, who has no pre-existing interest in another dwelling and where the replacement of main residence exception does not apply, is purchasing: 2 or more dwellings as part of a number of linked transactions, and the transactions have the same effective date the buyer will have a major interest in another dwelling at the end of the day of the effective date of each transaction, so all of the transactions will be subject to higher rates if the other conditions in  LTTA/8020(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#3581)(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#3581)  are met. Where the linked transactions are structured so that they take place on different days main residential rates will apply to the first transaction, and the higher residential rates will apply to the later additional dwelling transaction(s). As the transactions are linked and one of the transactions is at main rates and the other(s) at higher rates, to calculate the tax the taxpayer should follow a computation method which will result in an apportionment of the total consideration for all of the transactions between main rates and higher rates. To calculate the total tax due the taxpayer should follow the computation method detailed below. Computation method Where a taxpayer is buying 2 or more properties as part of a number of separate linked transactions, and one of the transactions is to be taxed at the main residential rates, and the other transaction(s) at the higher residential rates then the following computation method should be followed. Step 1 Calculate the tax for the entire consideration (for all transactions) at the main rates. Step 2 Calculate the tax for the entire consideration (for all transactions) at higher rates. Step 3 Calculate consideration for main rate transaction as percentage of total consideration. Step 4 Calculate consideration for higher rate transaction(s) as percentage of total consideration. Step 5 Multiply the total main rates tax (calculated at step 1) by the percentage of the consideration which is to be charged at main rates (calculated at step 3). Step 6 Multiply the total higher rates tax (calculated at step 2) by the percentage of the consideration which is to be charged at higher rates (calculated at step 4). Step 7 The total of step 5 and step 6 is the tax due. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A purchase 2 dwellings in 2 separate but linked transactions. The first transaction is for the sale of a house which is to replace Mr and Mrs A’s main residence and the consideration paid by Mr and Mrs A is £300,000. The replacement of a main residence exception applies to the first transaction. The second transaction is for a smaller property (a buy to let investment) and the consideration paid by Mr and Mrs A is £200,000. The total consideration is therefore £500,000. Mr and Mrs A should calculate the LTT due as follows: the tax due at main rates based on the total consideration of £500,000 is £15,000 the tax due at higher rates based on the total consideration of £500,000 is £37,450 the first transaction (to which the replacement main residence exception applies) accounts for 60% of the consideration. The tax due for the first transaction is therefore £9,000 (£15,000 x 0.6) the second transaction (which is higher rates) accounts for 40% of the consideration. The tax due for the second transaction is therefore £14,980 (£37,450 x 0.4) the total tax due for the transaction is £23,980

 Mr B is buying his first home for £250,000, and a neighbouring dwelling for £200,000 which he plans to let out. The properties are being sold in 2 separate but linked transactions with the same effective date. Both of the transactions will be subject to the higher residential rates. It is acceptable for Mr B to structure the transactions so that the effective date of his purchase of the dwelling that will become his main residence takes place on an earlier day than the purchase of his investment property. He would then pay main residential rates on the transaction for his main residence, and higher residential rates on the transaction for his investment property and would apply the computation method set out above.

237,237,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8100 An ‘only or main residence’," It’s a question of fact as to what’s someone’s only or main residence. Not dependent upon ownership of the place of residence by the individual living in the property. Most individuals have only one place of residence. That dwelling being their only or main residence. For example: a person who owns a flat and lives there permanently a person who rents a flat, and it’s where they live permanently If an individual rents a dwelling that’s their only or main residence and also owns a dwelling, they let out, even though they own one dwelling and rent the other, the dwelling they own will not be their only or main residence. Where the individual owns more than one dwelling Full facts need to be considered to establish where that individual’s main residence is. Example They live in Cardiff during the week with family and spend many weekends and several weeks during the year in Criccieth in a holiday home they own. On these facts alone, the main residence would be their Cardiff home. There’s no opportunity in LTT to nominate one of the residences as a main residence. But the main residence may well not be the residence where the individual spends most of their time. While usually, as above, it will be. Nourse J noted this in Frost v Feltham (Frost v Feltham (1981) 1 W.L.R. 452): ""If someone lives in two houses the question, which does he use as the principal or more important one, cannot be determined solely by reference to the way in which he divides his time between the two.” What to consider when examining what’s a person’s only or main residence Is the individual married, in a civil partnership, or co-habiting? If so, where does the spouse, civil partner or cohabitee live? Does the individual have children? If so, where do they live? Where do they go to school? At what residence is the individual registered to vote? Where is the individual’s place of work? How is each residence furnished? Which address is used for correspondence? Where is the individual registered with the doctor and dentist? Where is the individual’s car registered and insured? Which is the main residence for council tax? These are not exhaustive, and no single point is determinative. Dwellings owned or disposed of The question will be one of objective fact. Was the old dwelling at the relevant time the individual’s only or main residence? When considering an acquired dwelling, we look at whether it is the individual's intention that this will be their only or main residence. Facts related to that purchase may be relevant in either: supporting the taxpayer’s stated intention at the point of purchase, or indicating a different intention Examples: if the taxpayer obtains the new dwelling with a mortgage that was a buy-to-let product, this would indicate the taxpayer’s intention if the property was placed with a letting agent shortly after purchase, or had a sitting tenant with protected rights. It may indicate an intention not to use the property as an only or main residence Or if the property is near family and the taxpayer intends to move closer to them to provide care. But then that support is no longer needed, perhaps due to death or that relative moving. The evidence supports that intent, even if the taxpayer does not move to that dwelling.

Where a taxpayer has sold their former main residence before they buy their new main residence then, where the conditions are met, the taxpayer will pay the main rates and not the higher rates of LTT, irrespective of how many other properties they may own. The conditions are: on the effective date of the acquisition, the dwelling is intended to be the taxpayer’s only or main residence (‘main residence’) that during the 3 years ending on the effective date of the acquisition of the new main residence, the buyer or their spouse or civil partner at the time disposed of a major interest in a former main residence that they held no major interest in that former main residence, including any interest in the garden or grounds, following the disposal (unless a taxpayer’s spouse or civil partner retains a major interest in that property and they are no longer living with the taxpayer), and that no other dwelling that was intended to be a new main residence was acquired during the period between the sale of the former main residence and the acquisition of the new main residence

In the interim she lived in a dwelling she rented. Ms A is replacing her main residence and has done so within 3 years of the sale of the former main residence. The exclusion provided therefore applies to the purchase of the new main residence and the main rates of LTT will apply.

 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Mr C and Mr D acquire a new main residence. They have been in a civil partnership from 1 May 2010. Mr C had acquired his main residence (as sole owner) on 1 July 2008. Mr D had acquired his main residence (as sole owner) on 1 August 2007. Since 1 March 2009, Mr C and Mr D have lived in the dwelling owned by Mr C (Mr D has rented the dwelling he owns to tenants). On 1 September 2020 Mr C sells his home (and retains no interest in it). On the same day a new dwelling is acquired by Mr C and Mr D as joint tenants. The transaction is liable to the main rates of LTT, despite Mr D owning a second dwelling, because the former main residence was owned by Mr D’s civil partner and at the time of the disposal Mr C and Mr D were living together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3a 
 
 
   
 The facts concerning Mr C and Mr D are the same except they are not in a civil partnership. On the acquisition of the new dwelling the higher rates will apply (assuming that it costs more than £40,000 and all other relevant conditions apply) because Mr D has not replaced a main residence and owns another dwelling. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3b 
 
 
   
 The facts concerning Mr C and Mr D are the same as in 3a. However, before the purchase of the new main residence jointly, Mr C re-mortgages the existing main residence owned by him. It is decided that Mr D will become co-mortgagee for 50% of the mortgage outstanding and Mr D therefore also becomes owner of the dwelling as tenant in common with Mr C. The dwelling has a market value of £250,000 and the outstanding mortgage is £100,000. As there is an assumption/release of debt, Mr D is deemed to have acquired a major interest in the dwelling costing £50,000 (so he owns a 20% interest in the dwelling). As he already owns a dwelling, the higher rates apply to this transaction and the exemption for interests in the same main residence do not apply. Had Mr C and Mr D been in a civil partnership, the exemption would have applied as Mr D would be deemed to have an interest in the dwelling both before (due to the civil partnership) and after the transaction, and before and after that transaction, the dwelling is the buyers only or main residence.

 The facts are the same as in example 4a above. However, a week before the anticipated completion date (20 November 2018) the sellers ask if the contract can be varied so that the completion date becomes 5 December 2018. Mr and Mrs E agree.

Mr D had acquired his main residence (as sole owner) on 1 August 2007. Since 1 March 2009, Mr C and Mr D have lived in the dwelling owned by Mr C (Mr D has rented the dwelling he owns to tenants). On 1 September 2020 Mr C sells his home (and retains no interest in it). On the same day a new dwelling is acquired by Mr C and Mr D as joint tenants. The transaction is liable to the main rates of LTT, despite Mr D owning a second dwelling, because the former main residence was owned by Mr D’s civil partner and at the time of the disposal Mr C and Mr D were living together.

 Example 3b 
 
 
   
 The facts concerning Mr C and Mr D are the same as in 3a. However, before the purchase of the new main residence jointly, Mr C re-mortgages the existing main residence owned by him. It is decided that Mr D will become co-mortgagee for 50% of the mortgage outstanding and Mr D therefore also becomes owner of the dwelling as tenant in common with Mr C. The dwelling has a market value of £250,000 and the outstanding mortgage is £100,000. As there is an assumption/release of debt, Mr D is deemed to have acquired a major interest in the dwelling costing £50,000 (so he owns a 20% interest in the dwelling). As he already owns a dwelling, the higher rates apply to this transaction and the exemption for interests in the same main residence do not apply. Had Mr C and Mr D been in a civil partnership, the exemption would have applied as Mr D would be deemed to have an interest in the dwelling both before (due to the civil partnership) and after the transaction, and before and after that transaction, the dwelling is the buyers only or main residence.

Where a taxpayer has bought their new only or main residence (‘main residence’) before they sell their main residence, or the dwelling deemed to be their old main residence, where the conditions are met, the acquisition may become a replacement of a main residence. The taxpayer will have paid the higher rates of LTT when buying the new main residence as they held, or were deemed to hold, an interest in another dwelling (the old main residence) on the effective date of the transaction in which they acquired the new main residence. If the conditions are met, the taxpayer will be able to either amend the return under section 41 TCMA 2016 (if within the time limits permitted – 12 months from the filing date) or  make a claim for repayment(/node/25629)  under section 63 TCMA 2016. The deadline for making such a claim is 4 years from the day after the filing date for the return to which the claim relates. The repayment will be the difference between the amount of LTT paid and the amount of LTT that would have been payable, had main rates applied to the transaction and not the higher rates. The conditions are: on the effective date of the acquisition, the dwelling is intended to be the taxpayer’s only or main residence (‘main residence’) during the 3 years beginning on the day after the effective date of the acquisition of the new main residence, the buyer or their spouse, or former spouse, or civil partner or former civil partner at the time, disposes of a major interest in the buyer’s former main residence the property disposed of was the buyer’s former main residence at any time during the 3 years prior to the effective date of the acquisition that they hold no interest in that former main residence following the disposal (unless a taxpayer’s spouse or civil partner retains a major interest in that property and they are no longer living with the taxpayer)

The transaction effecting the acquisition of a dwelling acquired between the sale of the old main residence and the acquisition of the new main residence is called an ‘intermediate transaction’. Without these rules, it may be possible for the taxpayer to structure their purchases in such a manner that they can purchase 2 dwellings, neither of which is subject to the higher rates. The LTT intermediate transaction rules have been designed to ensure that the tax payable on the intermediate transaction must be reappraised in certain circumstances. An intermediate transaction is a higher rates residential property transaction if the intermediate transaction rules apply in relation to any one of the buyers. The intermediate transaction rules apply where: the buyer in an intermediate transaction replaces their main residence in another transaction within 3 years of the disposal of their previous only or main residence, and that intermediate transaction occurs during the interim period The interim period commences on the effective date of the transaction, effecting the disposal of the previous only or main residence, and ends on the effective date of a transaction to which the replacement of main residence exemption applies, or to which paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 4ZA to the Finance Act 2003 applies (SDLT), or paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 2A to the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (Scotland) Act 2013 applies.

The also includes cases where the taxpayer surrenders and is re-granted a lease on their main residence (and owns other dwellings as well) as well as where the taxpayer acquires a lease extension which is granted as a new but separate reversionary lease. The rules do not cover cases where a person acquires a different or additional interest in a dwelling that is not a main residence. Therefore if a person who owns a number of dwellings extends the lease on a dwelling that is not their main residence, they will, assuming the chargeable consideration is £40,000 or greater, be liable to the LTT higher rates on that land transaction.

 Mr and Mrs A recently married. They live in the dwelling owned (before the marriage) by Mrs A. Separately Mr A owns, with his brother a dwelling used as a holiday home. 6 months after the marriage they agree that Mr A will use his savings to pay down the mortgage on Mrs A’s dwelling and thereby acquire a 50% interest in the dwelling. To achieve this transaction they will need to re-mortgage. The dwelling has an open market value of £250,000 and a mortgage of £200,000.

 Ms B, Mr C and Ms D are 3 friends who purchased a property together as tenants in common, each with an equal share in the dwelling. The dwelling cost £350,000 with a mortgage of £300,000 (interest only). All 3 individuals occupy the dwelling as their only or main residence. 6 years after the acquisition, Mr C decides that he wants to move in with his partner. He does not wish to retain his interest in the property and it is decided that Ms B and Ms D will buy his undivided interest in the dwelling. Ms B does not hold any interest in any other dwelling, however, Ms D has a 50% interest in a buy to let dwelling owned with her brother. The property is now worth £480,000 and it is agreed that Ms B and Ms D will arrange for Mr C to be paid £160,000 for his share. The arrangement reached is that Ms B and Ms D will assume his debt in relation to the mortgage (£100,000) and pay him £60,000 cash. As the total consideration given for the land transaction is £160,000 Ms B and Ms C must make a return including this figure as the consideration given. The higher rates will not apply to this land transaction despite one of the buyers, Ms D, owning an interest in another dwelling.

246,246,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8190 Bare trusts and settlements – beneficiary deemed to be buyer or owner," (paragraphs 27 and 28 Schedule 5) The treatment of purchases of additional residential dwellings, for the purposes of the higher rates provisions, differs depending on whether the trustee is the trustee of a bare trust, a trust entitling the beneficiary to occupy the dwelling for life or income earned in respect of the dwelling or any other trust (a ‘settlement’). Where: a major interest in a dwelling, including the grant of a lease, or more than 1 dwelling is acquired by a trustee, or a number of trustees, of a settlement, alone or with others who are not trustees, and under the terms of the settlement the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) are entitled to occupy the dwelling for life or are entitled to the income earned; then in order to establish the liability to the higher rates, it is necessary to look at the beneficiaries to establish, if they had acquired the dwelling rather than the trust, they would be liable to the LTT higher rates. If the beneficiaries (or any one of them) would have been liable to pay the LTT higher rates then the trustee(s) must file their return including a self assessment calculated using the LTT higher rates. The beneficiary’s interest in dwellings also needs to be considered where there is a grant of a lease and the buyer is acting as a trustee of a bare trust. This is to ensure that leases cannot be granted to bare trustees and the usual rules relating to such a grant are not exploited to avoid the LTT higher rates applying. Similarly, where: a person is the beneficiary under a settlement a major interest in a dwelling forms part of the trust property, and under the terms of the settlement the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) are entitled to occupy the dwelling for life or are entitled to the income earned or where: a person is a beneficiary under a bare trust and a term of years absolute (that is a lease whether acquired by grant or assignment), in a dwelling forms part of the trust property; then in order to establish the liability to the higher rates it is necessary to look at the beneficiaries to establish if they held the interest in the dwelling rather than the trust. Therefore, for the purposes of establishing the ownership, or disposal of, interests held a person will be treated as owning, or disposing of interests in dwellings held or disposed by the trust.

The trustee buys a dwelling, costing £200,000. Whether the trustee needs to pay the LTT higher rates will depend upon the property owned by the beneficiary. The trustee will need to establish whether the beneficiary would, if they were acquiring the dwelling in their own right, be liable to the LTT higher rates. If the beneficiary would, perhaps because they own another interest in a dwelling that is worth £40,000 or more on the effective date of the acquisition by the trustees of the trust property, or the beneficiary is a child whose parents own dwellings, or the spouse of the beneficiary owns a dwelling, or the beneficiary is a company, for example. In the event that the beneficiary would not be liable to the LTT higher rates, had they acquired the dwelling in their own right then the trustees likewise will not need to pay the LTT higher rates. In the event that there was more than 1 beneficiary then each beneficiary would need to be considered separately, and, as for joint buyers, if the higher rates conditions are met in relation to one they are treated as being met in relation to all.

248,248,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8210 Acquisition by parent for minor child," (paragraph 30 Schedule 5) Where a parent acquires a dwelling for a minor child then the parent, or any spouse or civil partner of the parent, (including step-parents), is to be treated as the buyer, or as holding or disposing of the interest rather than the child. The connection rule to the spouse or civil partner of the child is only relevant if the married couple or civil partners are living together. However, it should be noted that in any case both natural parents will be considered to be the parent of the child so, whether living together or not, the natural parents are treated as acquiring, owning or disposing of the interest in the minor child’s dwelling even where the dwelling is being funded by just one of the parents. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A, the natural parents of AA, a minor child, decide to purchase a dwelling in the town that AA is to go to university. Mr and Mrs A own their family home. It is decided that the new dwelling is to be owned beneficially by AA rather than by their parents. Despite the beneficial interest in the dwelling being acquired in AA’s name (with the legal interest held through a bare trust in the parents’ names), the acquisition is liable to the LTT higher rates. Until AA turns eighteen Mr and Mrs A will be treated as holding the major interest in the dwelling. Had the dwelling been acquired in the same manner but after AA had turned 18 then the higher rates would not apply as money to acquire the dwelling had, effectively, been gifted to AA.

 Mr B and Ms C are unmarried partners and are the natural parents of BC, a minor child. Mr B and Ms C live in the dwelling owned entirely in Ms C’s name (current market value £200,000), and Mr B does not own any other interests in dwellings. Their child is also to attend university. Mr B decides that he will use part of an inheritance to purchase a dwelling for BC (to be beneficially owned by BC and legally owned by Mr B). Whilst Mr B and Ms C are not married and the acquisition is being effected by Mr B alone, the transaction will be liable to the LTT higher rates as Ms C is also BC’s parent and she does own an interest in a dwelling. Conversely, had Mr B purchased the legal and beneficial interest for himself, the acquisition would not have been liable to the higher rates as whilst Ms C owns a major interest which is Mr B’s main residence, it is not taken into account as he and Ms C are not married.

249,249,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8220 Acquisition by Court appointed deputy for minor child," (paragraph 30 Schedule 5) A special rule is provided so that the normal rule that a parent of the child is deemed to buy, hold or dispose of a dwelling does not apply where the buyer or owner is a deputy appointed by a court under section 16 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, or a person appointed under a similar provision in a country outside Wales and England. The dwelling must have been acquired in the child’s name or on behalf of the child. To qualify for the exclusion from the LTT higher rates the interest does not need to be acquired, held or disposed of solely by a court appointed deputy (or deputies), but one of the persons acquiring the dwelling must be a court appointed deputy. Such other owners could, for example, include the child’s parents or other relatives or guardians. Where a dwelling is acquired, held or disposed of by a deputy, that dwelling is not treated for the purposes of the LTT higher rates as if it were the child’s parents’ interest. Rather, exceptionally, the interest is treated as though, for the purposes of establishing the rates applicable to the transaction, or the interests in dwellings owned by the child’s parents, as though it is acquired or owned by the child. It is therefore possible for the parents of a child who has a court appointed deputy, to own an interest in a dwelling and for the child to acquire an interest in a dwelling through their deputy and for the child’s purchase not to be liable to the LTT higher rates. However, a second acquisition by the deputy on behalf of the child would potentially be liable to the LTT higher rates. Essentially, the child who has a court appointed deputy is treated, for the purposes of the LTT higher rates as though they are an adult. Their land transactions and their ownership of dwellings for the purposes of the LTT higher rates, are disconnected from their parent’s acquisitions and ownership of interests in dwellings. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 AA is a minor child who, as a result of medical negligence, has been awarded a substantial sum of money. B, a solicitor, has been appointed by the court under section 16 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 to be AA’s deputy. AA is living with their parents, in a home owned by those parents. Following the award AA’s parents make representations to B that their current home is not suitable for AA’s future needs. B agrees and approves the purchase of a more suitable home using some of the award. The dwelling is acquired by B in AA’s name. AA’s parents do not wish to sell their current home. The LTT higher rates will not apply. However, if B were subsequently, with the first dwelling still being owned, to acquire a second dwelling on AA’s behalf (perhaps to provide for capital growth and income) then that acquisition would be liable to the higher rates of LTT as AA, through their deputy, already owns an interest in a dwelling.

250,250,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8230 Major interests in dwellings inherited," (paragraph 34 Schedule 5) Where a taxpayer inherits an interest in a dwelling and that interest represents greater than 50% of the value of the interest, then the interest will be treated as owned by the taxpayer from the date of the inheritance. A taxpayer will be treated as owning a beneficial share of more than 50% if: they are, individually, entitled to an interest that is greater than 50% the taxpayer and their spouse or civil partner taken together own, as tenants in common, an interest of greater than 50%, or the dwelling is owned by no more than 3 joint tenants and 2 of those joint tenants are the taxpayer and their spouse or civil partner. It should be noted that any interests owned by minor children will be deemed as owned by their parent unless that interest is held as a result of an acquisition made by a court appointed deputy. Where the inherited interest is of 50% or less (owned by the taxpayer or, where relevant, taken together with interests owned by the taxpayer’s spouse or civil partner), it will not immediately be treated as an interest in another dwelling for the purposes of the higher rates rules. Instead, it will be treated as an interest owned in another dwelling only from 3 years after the date of inheritance. However, if during that 3 year period the taxpayer’s interest in the dwelling changes through: a variation of a disposition acquiring other interests in the dwelling, or marriage or entering into a civil partnership then if the interest is greater than 50% it will, immediately be treated as a major interest for the purposes of the higher rates legislation. The date of the inheritance means the date on which the individual acquires the interest and that acquisition is in or towards satisfaction of an entitlement under or in relation to the will, or the intestacy, of a deceased person. Special rules in relation to the date of inheritance, apply where there has been a variation of a disposition. Where such a variation occurs within 2 years of the person’s death then the date of inheritance is taken to be the date of acquisition in accordance with the variation.

 Mr AA and Miss BA are the son and daughter of Mrs A. Mrs A, a widow, dies on 1 January 2020. She owns 2 dwellings (of equal value - £200,000 each) which she leaves in equal shares to her 2 children. Probate is granted on 1 April 2020 and the properties are transferred to Mr AA and Miss BA, as tenants in common, at that point. As the 2 dwellings are owned equally neither Mr AA nor Miss BA owns an interest in an inherited dwelling of greater than 50%. In the event that neither owns any other interests in a dwelling that would qualify as a major interest, both could purchase a dwelling that would not be liable to the LTT higher rates during the 3 years following the date of inheritance.

However, following the grant of probate and the acquisition of the dwellings as tenants in common, Mr AA and Miss BA make a variation to the will so that the 2 dwellings are inherited individually, so that Mr AA owns one entirely and Miss BA owns the other. The variation occurs on the 1 October 2020. From that date Mr AA is treated as owning 100% of the interest in his property (and Miss BA as owning 100% of the interest in her property). If either acquired a major interest in another dwelling after that date then the higher rates would apply, despite the fact that the dwelling was inherited. If the new dwelling was acquired in the period when the inherited dwellings were owned as tenants in common and before 1 October 2020 then the higher rates would not apply (assuming that each does not own a major interest in another dwelling). The acquisition of a new dwelling on or following 1 October 2020 (and assuming it is not the replacement of an only or main dwelling) would be liable to the LTT higher rates.

In the absence of this rule, every transaction entered into by the financial institution in relation to alternative property finance arrangements, would be liable to the higher rates as it would be the financial institution which would be considered to establish if it was liable to the higher rates, and not the person who has entered the arrangement with the financial institution.

252,252,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Higher rates,LTTA/8250 Partnerships – interests acquired by a partner," (paragraph 32 Schedule 5) Note: ‘Partner‘ and ‘partnership’ in this section refer to business partners and not to spouses, civil partners or those co-habiting (where the spouse or civil partner is also a business partner then that will be made clear in the examples). Where a partner (who is an individual) in a partnership acquires a major interest in a dwelling either solely or jointly with other individuals and the dwelling is not being acquired for the purposes of the partnership, special rules apply. An example of this would be where the partner acquires their only or main residence, or where they acquire a buy-to-let property. That rule is that any major interests held by or on behalf of the partnership for the purposes of the trade are not treated as held by or on behalf of the partner. Therefore, if a partnership that trades as a property developer or a business that owns major interests in dwellings for the purpose of their trade, (for example a farming business) those interests are not treated as held by the individual partners. However, where a property is owned through a partnership and that property is used in a property letting business, the major interests in that dwelling are not used in a trade and the partner’s interest in that property will be treated as a major interest owned by the partner. It should also be remembered that the property acquired by a partnership is treated as acquired by the partners (see LTTA 5080). Therefore, when a partnership acquires a dwelling (for any purpose), it will be important to establish whether that purchase is liable to pay the LTT higher rates. In order to establish this, it will be important know whether any of the partners own major interests in dwellings for the purposes of establishing liability to LTT higher rates for the partnership acquisition. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Partnership Y consists of 4 partners who are individuals. The partners are entitled to equal income profit shares. They operate a property development and redevelopment trade. The partnership currently owns 4 dwellings that it is redeveloping for resale. Each dwelling has a value of £200,000. Partner A is buying her main residence (a first time buyer purchase). She is unmarried and not in a civil partnership, and owns no other interests in other dwellings. Despite the fact that, through the partnership she owns 4 major interests each worth £50,000, she will not be liable to LTT higher rates on the purchase of their main residence as the special rules relating to partners apply. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 The facts for partnership W are the same as for partnership Y above. However, 1 of the 4 dwellings it owns is let on assured shorthold tenancy agreements. As the dwelling is not held for the purposes of the trade (but rather is held for a property letting business, even if incidental to the trade), partner A will be treated as owning a major interest in another dwelling when she purchases her main residence. As such the LTT higher rates of LTT will apply to the acquisition of that dwelling. If Partner A was replacing her only or main residence, if she meets the requirements in, she would not be liable to LTT higher rates on the transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Partnership U is a newly formed partnership of 3 individuals. It will trade as a property developer and redeveloper. Its first purchase of stock is a flat costing £200,000. None of the partners own a major interest in a dwelling. The acquisition is liable to the main rates of LTT. A year later, that dwelling is sold and a new dwelling is acquired (this time for £105,000). In the year between the purchase of the original dwelling and the acquisition of the new dwelling, Partner B has also acquired, solely, a dwelling to use as his only or main residence (market value £150,000). This time the acquisition will be liable to the higher rates of LTT. This is because at the date of acquisition of the new partnership dwelling, 1 of the individuals purchasing the dwelling through the partnership, holds an interest in another dwelling that has a market value of £40,000 or more. The rule in relation to partnerships therefore applies to allow partners not to take partnership trading assets (dwellings) into account for what they hold when making a purchase, not for partnership purposes. It does not, however, operate in the reverse, namely; a partner’s interests in dwellings are relevant when establishing if a purchase made for the partnership’s trade is liable to the LTT higher rates. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Partnership Y consists of 4 partners who are individuals. The partners are entitled to equal income profit shares. They operate a property development and redevelopment trade. The partnership currently owns 4 dwellings that it is redeveloping for resale. Each dwelling has a value of £200,000. Partner A is buying her main residence (a first time buyer purchase). She is unmarried and not in a civil partnership, and owns no other interests in other dwellings. Despite the fact that, through the partnership she owns 4 major interests each worth £50,000, she will not be liable to LTT higher rates on the purchase of their main residence as the special rules relating to partners apply.

 Example 2 
 
 
   
 The facts for partnership W are the same as for partnership Y above. However, 1 of the 4 dwellings it owns is let on assured shorthold tenancy agreements. As the dwelling is not held for the purposes of the trade (but rather is held for a property letting business, even if incidental to the trade), partner A will be treated as owning a major interest in another dwelling when she purchases her main residence. As such the LTT higher rates of LTT will apply to the acquisition of that dwelling. If Partner A was replacing her only or main residence, if she meets the requirements in, she would not be liable to LTT higher rates on the transaction.

A transaction will not be treated as a higher rates residential property transaction if, at the end of the effective date of the transaction the following conditions are met: the interest purchased was subject to a lease the main subject matter of the transaction is reversionary on that lease the lease has an unexpired term of more than 21 years, and the lease is not held by a person connected with the buyer A person is connected to the buyer if they meet the conditions set out in Section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. The effect of the property being subject to a lease at the end of the day of the effective date of the transaction, is the same for an individual (or individuals) buying a single dwelling, or a number of dwellings in a single transaction, or where the buyer, or 1 of the buyers, is not an individual. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A owns a number of investment dwellings and his own home. He buys the freehold of a dwelling that is subject to a lease with an unexpired term of 30 years. The lease is held by Mrs Y, a person unconnected to Mr A. He pays £50,000 for the freehold interest. Whilst the chargeable consideration given is more than £40,000, he is not liable to pay the higher rates of LTT as the major interest acquired meets the conditions listed above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 Mrs B owns her home jointly with her husband. It has a market value of £300,000. Mrs B’s adult daughter, Miss B, has purchased a long lease on a house that she uses as her main residence. The lease has an unexpired term of 60 years. A year later the freehold becomes available for purchase. Miss B cannot afford to buy it. Mrs B agrees to purchase it for £45,000. As Mrs B already owns a major interest in a dwelling that has a market value of £40,000 or greater she will need to pay the higher rates of LTT on the freehold interest now acquired, as although the property acquired by Mrs B is subject to a lease, the lease is vested in a connected person, namely Miss B.

Mrs W (a widowed pensioner aged 70) enters into a home reversion arrangement with C Ltd. In return for a lifetime lease to occupy the property at a rent of £600 per month and £100,000, she sells her home to C Ltd (the dwelling has a market value of £200,000).

256,256,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,1. Application of SDLT to Wales," Subject to the transitional rules set out in section 2 below: 
 1.1 
 Where: 
 
 the effective date of a land transaction is on or after 1 April 2018; and 
 the subject-matter of the transaction consists of interests in land in Wales, or 
 to the extent that a cross-border transaction includes interests in land in Wales 
 
 then the transaction: 
 
 will not be treated as an acquisition of a chargeable interest by section 43 of the Finance Act 2003 (‘FA 2003’) and so SDLT will not apply, and 
 will not be linked for SDLT purposes under section 108 Finance Act 2003 with either:
	 
 a land transaction in Wales to which SDLT does apply, or, 
 a land transaction relating to land elsewhere in the UK, and 
 
 
 will be subject to land transaction tax (LTT) administered by the Welsh Revenue Authority(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) (WRA) 
 
 Use this tool to check whether the postcode of land or property you’re buying or leasing is located in Wales(https://www.gov.wales/find-out-if-postcode-wales-land-transaction-tax) . 
 1.2 
 Where a single transaction with an effective date on or after 1 April 2018 includes the acquisition of land in Wales and land elsewhere in the UK, it is treated as if it were 2 (or more) transactions: 
 
 one relating to land in Wales to be included in a LTT return to the WRA,  
 any transaction relating to land in England or Northern Ireland to be included in a SDLT return to HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs), and  
 any transaction relating to land in Scotland to be included in a land and buildings tax (LBTT) return to Revenue Scotland 
 
 1.3 
 In these cases the consideration given for the transaction should be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis (section 9 LTTA and section 48A FA 2003). Further guidance on cross-title and cross-border properties can be found at  HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) . 
 1.4 
 When submitting a land transaction return for SDLT you must enter a valid local authority code in each place where this is required. For transactions with an effective date on or after 1 April 2018 this will normally be a code relating to a local authority in England or Northern Ireland. For an LTT return for a transaction with an effective date on or after 1 April 2018 you must provide the Welsh local authority name. If you do not enter a valid code or name, you will not be able to submit an online return. A paper return will be rejected. 
 1.5 
 Special codes should be entered on the SDLT return for transactions in Wales covered by the transitional rules set out in paragraph 2 below and in certain other circumstances – see paragraphs 19.2, 21.1 and 21.5 below. See guidance in 1.3 above in relation to cross-title properties and the appropriate codes to use on the SDLT and LTT returns.

 Exceptionally, SDLT will continue to apply to transactions relating to or including land in Wales where the effective date is on or after 1 April 2018, and the transaction is: 
 
 effected in pursuance of a contract entered into and substantially performed on or before 17 December 2014 (the day on which the Wales Act 2014 received the Royal Assent) or, 
 effected in pursuance of a contract entered into on or before 17 December 2014 and not excluded by any of the following:
	 
 any variation of the contract, or assignment of rights under the contract, after that date; 
 the exercise after that date of any option, right of pre-emption or similar right; or 
 an assignment, sub-sale or other transaction relating to the whole or part of the subject-matter of the contract as a result of which a person other than the purchaser under the contract becomes entitled to call for a conveyance 
 
 
 
 2.2 
 HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) will not regard the following as excluding the transaction from a charge to SDLT under the transitional rules: 
 
 a transfer to the nominee or bare trustee of the purchaser under the contract.  
 Furthermore, HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) may not regard the following as excluding the transaction from a charge to SDLT under the transitional rules: 
 a variation of the completion date specified in the contract 
 
 2.3 
 Purchasers making an SDLT return for their transaction because of the operation of the transitional rules should enter local authority code 6999, not a Welsh local authority code, where required in the SDLT return (including any supplementary paper returns).

 The LTTA provides for a tax to be charged on land transactions, to be known as LTT, and makes provision about the key concepts underlying the tax. A land transaction with an effective date on or after 1 April 2018 will be subject to LTT to the extent that it includes interests in land situated in Wales, provided the acquisition of such interests in land is not subject to SDLT under the transitional rules described in parts 1 and 2. 
 3.2 
 Guidance regarding the application of LTT is available on this website. 
 3.3 
 The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 make provision in relation to certain transactions that began under SDLT but have an effective date on or after 1 April 2018. The intention is to ensure that such transactions are not subject to 2 taxes (SDLT and LTT) but are subject to one of the taxes. The regulations make provision to achieve that purpose for different types of land transactions or arrangements involving land transactions relating to land in Wales.

Linked transactions," Transactions occurring after 1 April 2018 that are subject to Land Transaction Tax cannot be linked to transactions occurring prior to 1 April 2018, which would have been subject to Stamp Duty Land Tax. The following examples highlight such scenarios: 
 
 
 
 
 5.1 Linked transactions (1) 
 
 
   
 A company (Company A) acquires 2 office buildings from another company (‘Company B’) and its subsidiary (Company C) on the same date. One of the buildings is in Bristol and the other is in Cardiff. The effective date of the transactions is on or after 1 April 2018. 
 The acquisition of the building in Cardiff is chargeable to LTT and a return must be made to WRA. The acquisition of the building in Bristol is chargeable to SDLT and a return must be made to HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs). The 2 transactions are not linked with each other for SDLT or LTT purposes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.2 Linked transactions (2) 
 
 
   
 The same company also negotiates the acquisition of 2 office buildings in Swansea from Company B. The negotiations were entered into in August 2016. Acquisition of the first building is completed before 1 April 2018 but negotiations for the acquisition of the second building conclude later and acquisition of this building is completed in a separate transaction on 1 April 2018. 
 The first acquisition is chargeable to SDLT and a return must be made for this to HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs). The second acquisition is chargeable to LTT and a return must be made to WRA. The 2 transactions are not linked with each other for SDLT or LTT purposes (although the transactions in Wales may be linked, and those in England may be linked to the transactions in example Linked transactions (1)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.3 Transitional rules (1) 
 
 
   
 Contracts are signed for the purchase of a house on 5 January 2018. The effective date of the transaction (the completion date) is 1 April 2018. 
 The purchase is not subject to SDLT as the effective date is on or after 1 April 2018. The transitional rules at section 16(5) and (6) of the Wales Act 2014 do not apply because the contract was not entered into (i.e. contracts were not exchanged) on or before 17 December 2014 (the date the Wales Act received Royal Assent).

 A rent-only non-residential lease is agreed under a verbal contract and substantially performed by the first annual rent payment on 1 September 2014 (before the Wales Act received Royal Assent). Paragraph 12A(2) of Schedule 17A to the FA 2003 treats the agreement as the grant of a lease, beginning with the date of substantial performance. 
 The lease remains chargeable to SDLT on and after 1 April 2018 for as long as it continues from year to year, or until the lease is granted, and a return must be submitted if SDLT becomes payable or additional tax becomes due (paragraph 4 Schedule 17A FA 2003). 
 Where the lease is granted, or a successive lease is treated as granted, after 1 April 2018, these transactions will be subject to LTT and not to SDLT.

 Specific provisions 
 Notes 
 
 The following guidance applies to the extent that the land transaction relates to land in Wales. The existing SDLT rules will continue to apply to the extent that the land transaction relates to land in England or Northern Ireland. Where necessary, the consideration for the transaction must be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis. 
 In all cases references to:
	 
 a land transaction where the effective date is before 1 April 2018 include a transaction which remains subject to SDLT by virtue of the transitional provisions at section 16(5) and (6) Wales Act 2014; and 
 a land transaction where the effective date is on or after that date exclude such a transaction

 Section 44A applies where a contract (the first contract) is entered into under which a chargeable interest in land is to be conveyed by one party to the contract (A), at the request of another (B), either to B or to a third person (C) who is not party to the contract. 
 6.2 
 If the first contract is substantially performed on or before 17 December 2014 (the day on which the Wales Act received Royal Assent), an obligation referred to at section 44A(6)(b) and a contract between B and C referred to at section 44A(7) will be subject to SDLT, even if the effective date of the transaction concerned is on or after 1 April 2018. 
 6.3 
 If the first contract is entered into on or before 17 December 2014 but not substantially performed, an obligation referred to at section 44A(6)(b) and a contract between B and C referred to at section 44A(7) will be subject to SDLT if the effective date of the transaction concerned is on or after 1 April 2018 and none of the exclusions at section 16(6) Wales Act 2014 applies to it. If any of the exclusions do apply then the transaction will be subject to LTT.

 Section 45 and Schedule 2A FA 2003 apply where a contract is to be completed by a conveyance but, before it is substantially performed or completed, the purchaser under that contract enters into a further agreement as a result of which another person is entitled to call for the conveyance of all or part of the subject-matter of the original contract. Such an agreement may take the form of an assignment of the rights under the contract or a sub-sale or other free-standing transaction. 
 7.2 
 If the assignment or free-standing transaction is completed or substantially performed by the transferee on or after 1 April 2018, neither the completion of the assignment or free-standing transaction, nor a transaction or notional transaction entered into by the transferor, will be subject to SDLT. They will instead be subject to LTT. 
 7.3 
 Unless the original contract was substantially performed on or before 17 December 2014, the transitional rules at section 16(5) and (6) Wales Act 2014 will not apply in these circumstances as the assignment of rights or free-standing transaction will exclude the transaction by virtue of section 16(6). 
 7.4 
 Schedule 2 to the LTTA Act provides rules relating to pre-completion transactions that will operate in the same manner as those rules currently in force at the date of publication of this guidance for SDLT. Any relief that may apply to the assignment of rights or the sub-sale or other free-standing transaction are to be found at paragraphs 18 and 19 of that schedule.

263,263,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,8. Options (section 46 FA 2003)," 8.1 
 The acquisition of an option binding the grantor to enter into a land transaction (or a right of pre-emption preventing the grantor from entering into, or restricting the right of the grantor to enter into, a land transaction) is treated as a land transaction separate from the exercise of the option or right. 
 8.2 
 If an option or right is acquired before 1 April 2018, the exercise of the option or right on or after 1 April 2018 is not subject to SDLT, regardless of whether or not the grant and the exercise are linked. The exercise of the option will be subject to LTT. The land transaction for the grant of the option (subject to SDLT) and the exercise (subject to LTT) will not be linked transactions. 
 8.3 
 If an option or right is acquired on or after 1 April 2018, it will be subject to LTT and a return in relation to that land transaction must be made to WRA. The exercise of the option will also be subject to LTT and a return must be made to WRA. The acquisition of the option or right and the exercise of the option are separate land transactions. However, they may be linked transactions for LTT purposes.

264,264,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,9. Exchanges (section 47 FA 2003)," 9.1 
 For SDLT purposes an exchange is treated as 2 separate transactions, each wholly or partly in consideration of the other. Where any of the interests transferred is a major interest in land, the chargeable consideration for each transaction is the market value of the interest acquired (paragraph 5 Schedule 4 FA 2003). 
 9.2 
 The exchanges rules in section 47 FA 2003 only apply where both transactions are subject to SDLT. Where, on or after 1 April 2018, land in England or Northern Ireland is exchanged for land in Wales, only the acquisition of the land in England or Northern Ireland is subject to SDLT and (as the acquisition of the land in Wales is not a land transaction for SDLT purposes) the exchanges rules contained in section 47 FA 2003 will not apply to the transaction. 
 9.3 
 The same principles apply where the transfer of land in England or Northern Ireland takes place before 1 April 2018 and the transfer of the land in Wales takes place on or after 1 April 2018. 
 9.4 
 In these cases the chargeable consideration for the transfer of land in England or Northern Ireland will be determined according to the rules for the valuation of non-monetary consideration etc., not the exchange rules at paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. The chargeable consideration is likely to be the market value of the interest disposed of, plus, where relevant, any equity payment or other consideration given.  
 9.5 
 Where, on or after 1 April 2018, land in England or Northern Ireland is exchanged for land in Wales, the acquisition of the land in Wales will be chargeable to LTT and, if the transaction is a notifiable transaction, a return must be made to WRA. For the purposes of the Welsh land transaction, the LTTA applies and it is likely that the chargeable consideration will be based on the market value of the property being disposed of in England or Northern Ireland, in addition to any other consideration given. 
 9.6 
 If both sides of the exchange involve land in Wales, and the first part of the exchange is prior to 1 April 2018 and the second part is on or after 1 April 2018, then the first part will be subject to SDLT and a return must be made to HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs). The second part will be subject to LTT and a return must be made to WRA. For both parts of the ‘exchange’, the rules that will apply for determining the chargeable consideration for SDLT and LTT purposes will be those in Schedule 4 of FA 2003 and Schedule 4 in LTTA Act 2017 (excluding paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to the FA 2003 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to the LTTA Act 2017). 
 9.7 
 If an exchange takes place on or after 1 April 2018 and the land involved in both parts of the exchange is in Wales, then the exchange rules in paragraph. 5 of Schedule 4 to the LTTA Act apply and returns must be made to WRA (It should be noted that the exchange rules in the LTTA differ from those in Finance Act 2003).  
 9.8 
 Where the transfer of land in Wales takes place before 1 April 2018 and the transfer of the land in England or Northern Ireland takes place on or after 1 April 2018, both transactions will be subject to SDLT and the exchanges rules in section 47 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to the FA 2003 will apply. This is because the 2 transactions are still both land transactions for the purposes of FA 2003.

 The provisions for contingent, uncertain or unascertained consideration, including the provisions for adjustment where a contingency ceases or consideration is ascertained (section 80 FA 2003) and applications to defer payment (section 90 FA 2003) remain unchanged for transactions in Wales which are subject to SDLT. This means that additional payments of SDLT may be due to HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) on or after 1 April 2018 where a contingency ceases or consideration is ascertained.

 For land transactions that are subject to LTT, the provisions for contingent, uncertain or unascertained consideration, including where a contingency ceases or consideration is ascertained, are contained in sections 18, 19, 20, 47 and 48 of the LTTA.

 Subject to conditions, the leaseback element of a sale and leaseback arrangement is exempt from charge to SDLT. 
 11.2 
 Where a sale of land in Wales takes place before 1 April 2018 and the leaseback takes place on or after 1 April 2018, the sale element will be subject to SDLT but the leaseback will not. The chargeable consideration for the sale element will be the market value of the leaseback and any other consideration given for the sale in money or money’s worth. Schedule 9 to the LTTA Act makes sale and leaseback relief available under LTT, so any leaseback on or after 1 April 2018 will be relieved from LTT despite the fact that the sale took place prior to 1 April 2018.

multiple dwellings relief (‘MDR’) is calculated based on the consideration given and the number of dwellings which are subject to SDLT.

 Only the acquisition of the 3 houses in Manchester is subject to SDLT. If MDR is claimed, the ‘total dwellings consideration’ for this purpose is £750,000 and the number of dwellings taken into account (‘total dwellings’) is 3.  
 The acquisition of the 3 houses in Wrexham will be subject to LTT. Multiple dwellings relief is available under LTT and is set out at Schedule 13 to the LTTA which operates in a similar way to the SDLT relief. 
 Where MDR is claimed in respect of an SDLT transaction (or linked transactions) which has an effective date before 1 April 2018 and includes an interest or interests in dwellings situated in Wales, the provisions of paragraph 6 of Schedule 6B (adjustment for change of circumstances) will continue to apply to the transaction, even if the event which gives rise to the adjustment occurs on or after 1 April 2018.

271,271,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,16. Higher rate for additional properties (Schedule 4ZA 2003) and higher rates residential property transactions (Schedule 5 LTTA 2017)," 16.1 
 A purchaser who already owns a dwelling in Wales, Scotland or elsewhere may be subject to the higher rates. For further details see [link]. 
 The higher rates of SDLT do not apply where a purchaser is replacing their main residence (paragraph 3(5) and (7)). The higher rates apply where the ‘new’ main residence is purchased before the ‘old’ one is sold, although the higher rates element may be reclaimed if the `old` main residence is sold within 3 years of the purchase of the `new` main residence. 
 Where a ‘new’ main residence is subject to the higher rates of SDLT and the subsequent sale of an ‘old’ main residence in Wales takes place on or after 1 April 2018, the higher rates element can still be reclaimed from HMRC(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) provided it is sold within 3 years of the purchase of the new one. 
 16.2 
 Paragraphs 8 and 17 of Schedule 5 to the LTTA provide that a transaction is not a higher rates residential property transaction where the dwelling acquired is intended to be a replacement for the buyer’s only or main residence and certain conditions are met. 
 16.3 
 One of those conditions requires the main residence to be replaced within 3 years of the buyer disposing of his or her original main residence. However, regulation 12 provides for a transitional rule where the transaction giving effect to the replacement of the main residence has an effective date which is 26 November 2018 or earlier. 
 16.4 
 In these cases, Regulation 12 makes certain modifications to the rules prescribed by paragraphs 8 and 17. The effect of these modifications is to disapply the 3 year window during which a previous main residence had to be sold before the purchase of a new main residence. In these transactions (and subject to the other conditions being met), the replacement of main residence exception will apply, and the transaction will be chargeable at the main rates of LTT and not the rates that apply to higher rates residential property transactions. 
 
 
 
 
 16.5 Example 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A sold their main residence on 1 March 2015 as they were going abroad to work, they choose to rent a home whilst overseas. They also own a buy to let property. On 1 September 2018 they return to Wales and on 20 November 2018 they buy a dwelling that is to be their new main residence. The higher residential rates will not apply to this transaction as the dwelling being acquired by Mr and Mrs A is intended to be a replacement of their only or main residence and the effective date of the transaction occurs on or before 26 November 2018. However, in the event that the effective date of the transaction occurs on 27 November 2018 or later, then the higher residential rates will apply to the transaction as the condition requiring the disposal of the previous main residence within 3 years will apply, and they will not meet that condition.

272,272,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,17. Shared ownership leases (section 70/Schedule 9 FA 2003)," 17.1 
 Where the grant of a shared ownership lease was an SDLT transaction (and a market value election has not been made), any staircasing transaction following in which the lessee’s total share in the dwelling does not exceed 80% is exempt from charge to SDLT and will be relieved from LTT on a claim. If the transaction is not notifiable, perhaps because the increased share cost less than £40,000, no return and claim to relief is required. 
 17.2 
 Where the grant of a shared ownership lease is was an SDLT transaction in Wales (i.e. before 1 April 2018), any staircasing which takes the lessee’s total share of the dwelling over 80%, or the acquisition of the reversion, will be subject to LTT. This is the case even if a purchase under such an arrangement commenced when SDLT was in force.

 Sections 71of FA2003 provide for relief where a purchase is funded by an alternative property finance arrangement, ensuring that the SDLT payable on such a transaction is in line with that payable on a purchase financed with an interest bearing mortgage 
 18.2 
 Alternative property finance relief is also available under LTT and is provided for in Schedule 10 to the LTTA. To ensure that a party entering into a land transaction under an alternative property finance arrangement prior to 1 April 2018 is not disadvantaged by the transition to LTT in Wales, regulation 5 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that the third transaction described in section 71A FA 2003 will not be subject to LTT. 
 18.3 
 For example, if the first transaction occurs under SDLT, that is before 1 April 2018, and meets the conditions for SDLT relief to be claimed then where the subsequent transactions that are part of that alternative finance arrangement, occur after on or after 1 April 2018, they will be eligible for relief under the LTT rules and returns must be made to WRA.

 A land transaction relating to land in Wales which is a ’first transaction’ for the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 61 FA 2009, will be exempt from charge to SDLT if the effective date of the transaction is before 1 April 2018 and the conditions for relief are met. In this case SDLT will become chargeable under paragraph 7(3) of Schedule 61 if relief is withdrawn at any time, even if this withdrawal occurs on or after 1 April 2018. 
 19.2 
 A land transaction relating to land in Wales which is a ‘second transaction’ for the purposes of paragraph 8 of Schedule 61 will be exempt from charge to SDLT if the effective date of the transaction is before 1 April 2018 and conditions in that paragraph are met.  
 19.3 
 In either case, the transaction will not be subject to SDLT if the effective date is on or after 1 April 2018. 
 19.4 
 Relief for alternative finance investment bonds is also available under LTT and is provided for in Schedule 11 to the LTTA. To ensure that a party entering into a land transaction in connection with an alternative finance investment bond prior to 1 April 2018 is not disadvantaged by the transition from SDLT to LTT in Wales, regulation 6 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that the second transaction for the purposes of paragraph 8 of Schedule 61 FA 2009 will not be chargeable to LTT when the conditions in paragraph 8(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 61 FA 2009 have been met.

 The provisions of section 75A apply to a disposal and acquisition of a chargeable interest in land in Wales where the effective date of the notional transaction (section 75(6)) is before 1 April 2018. 
 20.2 
 As well as a general anti-avoidance rule (‘GAAR’) introduced into the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016 by the LTTA, section 31 of the LTTA Act contains a targeted anti-avoidance rule (‘the reliefs TAAR’) which prohibits a claim for relief from LTT where the transaction is, or forms part of, a tax avoidance arrangement. Guidance on both these rules is available from the WRA website (www.WRA).

 a land transaction relating to land in Wales has an effective date before 1 April 2018, but is not notifiable for SDLT purposes; and 
 the transaction becomes notifiable on or after 1 April 2018 by reason of a later SDLT transaction which is linked to it;

 A buyer acquires a field in Wales prior to 1 April 2018 (the first transaction). The consideration (£35,000) given for the field is below the SDLT notification amount. The acquisition of the field in Wales is part of a series of transactions. The second, and final transaction, is the purchase of a field wholly in England that occurs on 1 April 2018. The second transaction is for £250,000. The 2 transactions remain linked for SDLT purposes as the first (Welsh) transaction occurred prior to LTT coming into force. A further return, under section 81A FA 2003 is required for the first transaction.

 A transfer of a partnership interest which falls to be treated as a land transaction by virtue of paragraph 17 of Schedule 15 FA 2003 will not be subject to SDLT, to the extent that the transfer of land to the partnership referred to in that paragraph includes land in Wales and the effective date of the later deemed land transaction is on or after 1 April 2018. This applies even if the transfer of land to the partnership took place before that date. 
 22.2 
 Regulation 7 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that any partnership transfer under paragraph 17(1) of Schedule 15 FA 2003 that takes place on or after 1 April 2018 will be chargeable to LTT.

 A ‘qualifying event’ (e.g. a withdrawal of money from the partnership) which falls to be treated as a land transaction by virtue of paragraph 17A of Schedule 15 FA 2003 will not be subject to SDLT, to the extent that the transfer of land to the partnership referred to in that paragraph includes land in Wales, where the effective date of the later deemed transaction is on or after 1 April 2018.

278,278,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Transitional,23. Leases (section 120 and Schedule 17A FA 2003)," 23.1 
 Leases that continue after a fixed term (paragraph 3 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 Paragraph 3 provides that, where a lease continues after a fixed term, it is treated as a lease for the fixed term plus one year (and so on). Where, as a result tax, or more tax, becomes due a return or further return must be submitted within 30 days of the end of the one-year period concerned (see paragraph 3(4)). 
 Where a lease of land in Wales is granted before 1 April 2018 and in accordance with this provision tax, or more tax, becomes due on or after that date, the lease remains subject to SDLT. 
 If as a result the grant of the lease becomes notifiable for the first time, a return must be submitted in the usual way – see SDLTM12050 paragraph 1. The last day of the one year period giving rise to the notification requirement (not the date on which the lease was granted) must be entered at Box 4. In this case the special LA code 6998 (not a Welsh LA code) must be entered in the return. 
 If the grant of the lease has already been notified and additional tax becomes due, notification should be made by letter to Birmingham Stamp Taxes – see SDLTM 12050 paragraph 2. 
 23.2 
 Leases for an indefinite term (paragraph 4 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 A lease for an indefinite term (e.g. a lease for life – see SDLTM18715) is treated in the first instance as if it were a lease for a fixed term of a year. If the lease continues after the end of that term it is treated as a lease for a fixed term of 2 years, and so on. 
 A lease for an indefinite period of land in Wales which is granted before 1 April 2018 will continue to be subject to SDLT even if it continues after the end of such a term on or after 1 April 2018. 
 23.3 
 Successive linked leases (paragraph 5 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 The provisions of paragraph 5 do not apply in respect of a successive lease of land in Wales granted on or after 1 April 2018, because in this case the successive lease granted is not subject to SDLT and cannot be linked with any transaction which has an effective date before 1 April 2018. Where a lease is granted with an effective date on or after 1 April 2018, it will be chargeable to LTT under Schedule 6 to the LTTA. 
 23.4 
 Adjustment where rent ceases to be uncertain (paragraph 8 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 Where a lease of land in Wales is granted before 1 April 2018 and, in accordance with this provision, tax, or more tax, becomes due on or after that date, the lease remains subject to SDLT. If the transaction is a notifiable transaction, a return or further return must be submitted within 30 days of the end of the 5th year of the period of the lease or, if earlier, the date on which the amount of rent payable in the first 5 years ceases to be uncertain (see paragraph 8(4)). 
 If the lease becomes notifiable for the first time, a return must be submitted in the usual way. The date prescribed by paragraph 8(1) (not the date on which the lease was granted) must be entered at Box 4. In this case the special LA code 6998 (not a Welsh LA code) must be entered in the return. 
 If the grant of the lease has already been notified and additional tax becomes due, notification should be made by letter to Birmingham Stamp Taxes – see SDLTM 18525. 
 23.5 
 Overlap relief (paragraph 9 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 Where a lease of land in Wales granted before 1 April 2018 is surrendered or terminated and a new lease granted in its place on or after that date, the new lease will not be subject to SDLT. 
 The new lease will be chargeable to LTT under Schedule 6 to the LTTA. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 6 LTTA makes provision to discount the LTT chargeable when a new lease has been granted in place of an old lease in any of the circumstances set out in paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 6. To ensure that a party that is entering into a new lease when the old lease had an effective date prior to 1 April 2018 is not disadvantaged by the switch from SDLT to LTT, regulation 9 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that where an old lease is granted prior to 1 April 2018, the chargeable consideration for the new lease will be discounted to reflect the rent that would have been payable under the old lease (but not to a negative amount).  
 23.6 
 Backdated leases granted to tenant holding over (paragraph 9A of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 The grant of a lease of land in Wales where the effective date is on or after 1 April 2018 will not be subject to SDLT even where the term of the lease is expressed to begin before 1 April 2018. 
 The grant of a new lease of land in Wales where the effective date is on or after 1 April 2018 will be subject to LTT under Schedule 6 to the LTTA. 
 23.7 
 Assignment of lease on or after 1 April 2018 where lease was granted prior to 1 April 2018 
 Where a lease of land in Wales is entered into prior to 1 April 2018, and is assigned on or after 1 April 2018, the assignment may be subject to LTT if there is a premium or consideration other than rent paid for the assignment. 
 23.8 
 Assignment of lease treated as grant of lease (paragraph 11 of Schedule 17A FA 2003) 
 Where a lease of land in Wales is granted before 1 April 2018, an assignment of the lease on or after that date will not be subject to SDLT and the provisions of paragraph 11 will not apply to treat that assignment as a grant of a lease. 
 Regulation 10 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that where a lease was granted prior to 1 April 2018 and it was relieved or exempt from SDLT, it will be treated as the grant of a new lease for LTT purposes. 
 23.9 
 Variations of leases - Increases of rent treated as grant of new lease (paragraph 13 of Schedule 17A FA 2003); Increase in the term of a lease or the extension of premises treated as the grant of a new lease. 
 A variation of a lease of land in Wales which falls within the terms of paragraph 13 will not be treated as the grant of a lease for SDLT purposes where the effective date of such a grant would be on or after 1 April 2018. 
 Regulation 11 of The Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018 provides that a variation of a lease of land in Wales involving an increase of rent which takes place on or after 1 April 2018 will be treated as the grant of a new lease for LTT purposes.  
 The regulation therefore makes it clear that such an event is to be treated for the purpose of LTT as the grant of a new lease and therefore chargeable to LTT and not to SDLT. However, because SDLT will have already been charged on the rent to that date of the grant of the new lease, LTT is charged only on any increase in rent.

280,280,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2000 Land transactions," Land Transaction Tax (LTT) is a devolved tax that applies to transactions involving the acquisition of chargeable interests in land and buildings in Wales. LTT replaces Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) in Wales. 
 The tax was introduced by the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017. This guidance is intended to supplement and clarify the detail in the Act and supporting subordinate legislation.  
 The tax operates in relation to transactions in Welsh land that occur on and from 1 April 2018. 
 However, for certain transactions that complete on or after 1 April 2018, for certain extensions to leases, and for certain transactions in land by partners in partnerships, transitional rules may apply. 
 This guidance broadly follows the layout of the legislation, but the  details on the individual reliefs that may be claimable by a taxpayer are provided here(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/section/30) . 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
281,281,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2010 Land transactions and chargeable interests," (Sections 2-4 LTTA) 
 Land Transaction Tax (‘LTT’) is chargeable on land transactions. The tax applies whether or not there is any instrument (for example a contract) effecting the transaction, wherever such an instrument is executed and wherever any party to the transaction may be resident. Additionally, land transactions that are effected as a result of an order by a court or as a result of an enactment, are also land transactions for the purposes of LTT. 
 A land transaction is the acquisition of a chargeable interest by a buyer. 
 A ‘chargeable interest’ means: 
 
 an estate, interest, right or power in, or over land in Wales, or 
 the benefit of an obligation, restriction or condition affecting the value of any such estate, interest, right or power 
 
 other than an ‘exempt interest’. 
 Chargeable interests in Wales include: 
 
 a freehold estate (the nearest equivalent to absolute ownership, sometimes referred to as an ‘estate in fee simple’) 
 a commonhold estate (found in blocks of flats where the owner owns a freehold interest in their flat and is a member of the commonhold association which owns and manages the common areas) 
 a leasehold estate (sometimes referred to as a ‘term of years’) 
 an undivided share in land 
 a right in or over land such as an easement or profit a prendre, for example a right of light 
 a rentcharge 
 the right to receive rent including ground rent 
 the benefit of a restrictive covenant 
 the benefit of a positive covenant (an example of the benefit of an obligation) 
 an equitable or beneficial interest in land such as a life interest or an interest in reversion or in remainder 
 a executor’s or trustee’s power of appointment (the only likely example in practice of a power over land) 
 an option 
 
 A chargeable interest is an interest in land, so this would not include movable items within the property or on the land such as fittings (e.g. curtains, carpets and furniture). However, what are commonly referred to as fixtures, are to be treated as part of the chargeable interest. For example, fitted kitchen cupboards and baths and toilets are to be treated as part of the chargeable interest. Further guidance can be found in  LTTA/2261(https://beta.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance#section-12827) . 
 Land in Wales does not include land below the low water mark. It does however include jetties, piers and similar structures where one end is attached to land in Wales. It also includes land underwater above the low water mark, for example lakes and rivers.

282,282,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2020 Exempt interests," Certain interests in land are ‘exempt interests’. Transactions involving exempt interests are not chargeable to LTT. Certain transactions involving chargeable interests are exempt from charge. 
 The following are exempt interests: 
 
 a ‘security interest’, that is, an interest or right (other than a rentcharge) held for the purpose of securing the payment of money or the performance of any other obligation. The commonest example of a security interest is a mortgage 
 a licence to use or occupy land (however, a document which describes itself as a licence may in fact be a lease, especially if the practical consequence is that the grantee has exclusive occupation) 
 a tenancy at will (however, a tenancy described as a tenancy at will may in fact be some other tenancy such as a periodic tenancy, especially if rent is paid) 
 a franchise granted by the Crown, for example, the right to hold a market or to take tolls 
 a manor (the ‘Lordship of the Manor’ or seignory, but note that a seignory may be accompanied by chargeable interests such as profits a prendre) 
 
 A ‘licence’ is permission given by the owner of land to another person to use the land. A licence allows someone to enter the land of another. It permits them to access the land where it would otherwise amount to trespass. Importantly, it does not confer any interest in the land to the person who is granted the licence. However, if there is exclusive possession given by the licence then the arrangement is likely to be a lease rather than a licence. 
 A ‘tenancy at will’ is an arrangement, whether documented or not, where the tenant occupies land as tenant with the consent of the owner on the basis that the arrangement can be brought to an end by either party at any time. The arrangement also automatically ceases if either party dies or if the owner sells the land. A tenancy at will, because it does not create an estate, and cannot therefore be assigned by the tenant or their executor, is not treated as a lease for the purposes of LTT. 
 A chargeable interest held by a financial institution as part of an alternative property finance arrangement may be an exempt interest if it meets certain conditions.

283,283,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2030 Acquisition and disposal of chargeable interest," (Section 6 LTTA) 
 Obligations under LTT are to be met by the buyer, or the deemed buyer, that is the person, or persons, who are acquiring the chargeable interest. 
 A person, the buyer, acquires a chargeable interest when: 
 
 that person becomes entitled to the interest (whether on its creation or subsequently) 
 that person’s interest benefits by the surrender or release of the interest, or 
 that person benefits from any variation to the interest 
 
 A person, the seller, disposes of a chargeable interest when: 
 
 that person ceases to be entitled to the interest or the interest becomes subject to the newly created interest 
 that person ceases to be entitled to the interest on surrender or release, or 
 that person’s interest is subject to or limited by the variation of the interest 
 
 The acquisition of an interest will therefore include the acquisition of a freehold interest and the assignment of a lease from a former tenant by a new tenant. It will also include the creation of an interest, so, where a lease is granted out of another interest (either a freehold or superior lease) the person being granted the lease is acquiring that interest and is the buyer of the newly created interest in the property. Where a lease is surrendered or the tenant is released from the lease, the landlord has acquired an interest in the property. 
 Furthermore, where: 
 
 the tenant gives the landlord consideration in money or money’s worth for the variation of a lease, but the rent and the term of the lease do not change, the variation is treated as an acquisition of a chargeable interest by the tenant 
 the variation of a lease reduces the rent, it is treated as an acquisition of a chargeable interest by the tenant, or 
 the variation of a lease reduces the term of the lease, it is treated as an acquisition of a chargeable interest by the landlord

284,284,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2040 Linked transactions," (section 8 LTTA) 
 There are some situations when 2 or more property transactions that involve the same buyer and seller or connected persons, are treated as being linked for LTT purposes (see  LTTA 6100(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5561)  and  6110(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5565)  for further guidance on calculating the tax payable on linked transactions and where a LTT return, or further return, may need to be made in consequence of a later linked transaction). 
 Transactions are linked where they form part of a single scheme, arrangement, or series of transactions between the same buyer and seller or persons connected to them. They may be concurrent or successive. Section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 applies to determine whether the parties are connected. 
 Transactions are not linked where the same individuals fulfil different roles in each transaction. For example, where: 
 
 in one transaction, Mr A is the buyer and Mr B is the seller, and 
 in a second transaction, Mr B is the buyer and Mr A is the seller 
 
 the transactions will not be linked, unless Mr A and Mr B are connected persons.  
 These rules aim to ensure that transactions cannot be artificially split into smaller transactions (or separate parts bought by connected persons) in the hope of reducing or eliminating the LTT payable. People connected to a buyer or seller will count as being the same buyer or seller where the land transactions form part of a single scheme, arrangement or series of transactions. 
 If 2 transactions are documented separately, the form in which the transactions are documented will not determine whether they are linked or not. For example, documenting transactions with separate contracts will not prevent them being linked if the transactions are under arrangements which indicate they are part of a single scheme, etc. These arrangements do not need to be in writing or be legally binding. 
 A series of transactions means something more than that one transaction follows the other. There must be something else to connect the transactions. 
 However, it would be a question of fact whether the purchases are totally unrelated. In particular the buyer needs to consider whether the fact that the first transaction had happened had affected the terms of the second transaction. 
 Where successive transactions are linked, for example the grant of an option and its exercise, extra tax can be due for the first transaction.  
 Any extra tax is payable at the same time as tax is payable on the second transaction. 
 Linked transactions with the same effective date can, if the buyer chooses, be reported as a single notifiable transaction using a single land transaction return. 
 Where this is done, the transactions will be treated as a single transaction and all the purchasers, if more than one will be treated as joint purchasers. 
 
 Special cases 
 Where an option has been granted the grant of the option and the exercise of the option will be linked transactions. However, if the person who has acquired the option does not exercise it within the time limits in which the rights under the option can be exercised, then, if the seller has sought alternative buyers, the grant of the option and its exercise will not be linked transactions. 
 Where transactions are linked but the nature of the land in the subsequent transaction differs from that in the first or earlier transactions, the tax rates and bands applying to the earlier transactions may change. For example, the acquisition of a residential property in the first transaction will be liable to the residential (or the higher residential rates), if a later linked transaction occurs for non-residential land then both transactions will need to be treated as mixed transactions and the non-residential rates applied (subject to any relevant claims to multiple dwellings relief). 
 However, if, as a result of a later linked transaction, there is less tax payable on an earlier transaction, the taxpayer may only claim a repayment if they meet the conditions for repayment to be made. In particular, if the time limit for making the repayment claim has passed then no claim can be made. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mrs A owns a house and garden and a field that adjoins the garden. She markets them for sale at the same time. Mr and Mrs B currently own no residential property. They make an offer for the house, the garden and the field. They however, contract to acquire the property in the following manner: Mr B will purchase the house and gardens and Mrs B will acquire the field. The transactions are linked because the buyers are the same person (or persons connected to them) and the seller is the same person. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2a 
 
 
   
 Mr C, a farmer, is looking to gradually reduce the size of his farm in the run up to his retirement (he is keeping his intentions private). In 2020 he puts a field on the open market. It is acquired by Ms D a neighbouring farmer. 2 years later in 2022 he puts a further 2 fields on the market, one is acquired by Y Ltd, a land holding vehicle for a farming co-operative. The second is acquired by Ms D. The 2 transactions in 2020 and 2022, even though they are between the same seller and buyer, are not linked as they do not form part of a single scheme or arrangement of transactions. They are also not part of a series of transactions as whilst one follows the other they are unconnected to each other. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2b 
 
 
   
 The facts are broadly the same as in example 2a above. However, Mr C told Ms D of his intention to sell land in the run up to his retirement. Ms D expressed an interest in acquiring other fields Mr C offered for sale. When Mr C decides to sell the 2 fields in 2022 he approaches Ms D to see if she wishes to acquire them. Ms D does not want the first field, which is then marketed and sold to Y Ltd as in example 2a. The second field is sold to Ms D. As there was an understanding that the fields would be offered to Ms D, and the second filed was not offered for sale to anyone else either privately or on the open market, the 2 transactions between Mr C and Ms D are linked. The transactions are linked because there is an arrangement whereby Ms D is given first refusal to acquire the fields, and that first refusal arises out of the discussions related to the first transaction. Therefore an arrangement does not need to be legally enforceable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Mr E1 and his brother Mr E2 are separately trying to build up buy-to-let portfolios. They both own their own homes. A new block of flats has just launched and Mr E1 visits the block and wants to buy 2 of the flats. Mr E1 mentions to his brother that the flats appear to be capable of producing good rental returns. Mr E2 visits the block and agrees with his brother’s conclusion (he wants to buy 3 of the flats). They agree to approach the builder selling the flats and negotiate a single price for the purchase of all 5 flats (or alternatively discounts from all 5 flats achieved as they are making a number of purchases at the same time). The contracts are drawn up so that Mr E1 and Mr E2 contract separately to acquire their flats. The transactions are linked as the buyers are connected to each other and the transactions were part of a single scheme. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4a 
 
 
   
 Mx G is looking to create a buy-to-let portfolio. They have acquired a number of properties from the same builder and are considered by the builder to be a great customer. The builder is approaching the end of a project and, as they have done previously (at Mx G’s request) contacts Mx G and other previous buyers they know are interested in buy-to-let portfolios, to see if they are interested in purchasing the few remaining properties available. Mx G wants to buy one of the properties and agrees a price with the developer. The transaction is not linked to the previous transactions as whilst transactions have occurred between the same buyer and seller, the fact that the properties were made available to others to buy at the same time does not make the transactions form part of a series of transactions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4b 
 
 
   
 The facts are the same as in example 4a above. As part of the discussions to agree the price for the property MxG agrees to buy 2 flats in another development being built by the developer that will complete later that year. These 3 transactions are linked as they form part of a single scheme, the cost of one property being agreed based on MxG entering into agreements to purchase 2 other properties.

 U Ltd owns a piece of land that W Ltd is interested in purchasing if it can obtain planning permission. In order to ensure that it will be in a position to purchase the land in the event that planning permission is granted W Ltd pays U Ltd £200,000 for the grant of an option to buy the land within 3 years of the grant of the option for £2,300,000. The date of the grant of the option is 1 March 2020. An LTT return for that land transaction must be sent to WRA by 31 March 2020. W Ltd obtains planning permission on 1 September 2022 and exercises the option on 1 October 2022, paying U Ltd the additional £2,300,000. The transactions are linked and W Ltd must make a return for the second land transaction to WRA by 31 October 2022. Within the same time limit it must also make a further return for the transaction relating to the grant of the option.

285,285,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050 Transactions exempt from charge," (Schedule 3 LTTA) 
 The acquisition of an exempt interest is outside the charge to LTT. 
 There are 5 types of land transactions which are specifically exempt from LTT. No tax is charged on these transactions and no LTT return is required. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
286,286,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050a No chargeable consideration," Land or buildings may be gifted or the ownership transferred to another person for no 'chargeable consideration'. This means that no money (or money’s worth) is given by the buyer (or on their behalf) to the seller, and there is no other consideration which has a monetary value. 
 However, where a land transaction involves the buyer both being gifted property and assuming existing debt (such as paying a mortgage debt), the debt assumed is chargeable consideration for LTT purposes. 
 This exemption does not apply where the deemed market value rules apply. In such cases, specific rules apply so that the consideration given is based on the open market value of the subject matter of the transaction. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
287,287,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050b Acquisitions by the Crown," The acquisition of a chargeable interest by one or more of the following is an exempt transaction: 
 
 the Welsh Ministers, the First Minster for Wales and the Counsel General to the Welsh Government 
 a Minister of the Crown 
 the Scottish Ministers 
 a Northern Ireland department 
 the National Assembly for the Wales Commission 
 the Corporate Officer of the House of Lords or of the House of Commons 
 the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, and 
 the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission 
 
 However, any land transactions that includes a buyer who is one of the above persons and a person not listed above, will not be an exempt transaction. LTT will be payable on the full consideration given unless a specific relief applies, for example relief for acquisitions by public bodies (where the seller and one of the buyers is a public body), or, trunk roads relief. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
288,288,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050c Transactions in connection with a divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership," Certain transactions made in connection with the ending of a marriage, or a civil partnership formed under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, are exempt from LTT. 
 The exempt transactions are those made between the parties to the marriage or civil partnership as a result of: 
 
 certain types of court order 
 an agreement between the spouses/civil partners in contemplation or in connection to the dissolution or annulment of their marriage or civil partnership, or 
 their judicial separation or a separation order 
 
 The exemption is not available if the transaction involves someone other than the spouses or civil partners. For example if the property is transferred under a court order or agreement to one spouse or civil partner and their new partner, or to one spouse or civil partner and the children of the marriage or civil partnership. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
289,289,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050d Assent and appropriations by personal representatives," This exemption applies when property is transferred to another person in a will or on intestacy (i.e. the deceased person did not make a will). The exemption includes property that has outstanding debt secured on it, for example debt secured by a mortgage. 
 Where the personal representative becomes a trustee of the property on the granting of probate, the transfer of the asset is exempt unless there is any consideration given for the transfer of the property. Similarly, if that person is also a beneficiary of the will, when the property is transferred to them as beneficiary, the transaction will be exempt unless any consideration is given for the transfer of the property. 
 The transaction is not an exempt transaction if consideration is given for the property (exceptionally this does not include the assumption of secured debt i.e. debt which was secured on the property immediately after the death of the person). 
 For example, if the person to whom the property is transferred makes a payment to the executor of the will to enable other beneficiaries of the will to maintain the share of the estate left to them, the amount given is treated as consideration for the land transaction. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transactions
290,290,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Land transactions,LTTA/2050e Variation of testamentary dispositions etc.," This exemption applies to transactions which change the terms of a will or intestacy (within 2 years of someone dying) so that a different beneficiary receives a property. Provided the new beneficiary does not make any compensation payment, including, potentially, the assumption of a mortgage or other debt, the transaction is exempt from LTT. A variation in the terms of the will or intestacy in favour of the original beneficiary, does not count as a compensation payment - for example, leaving them something else instead of the property. 
 In the event that there is chargeable consideration given for the property (such as an equalisation payment), there will, depending upon the transaction being notifiable, be a chargeable transaction. In such cases the parties to the transaction are the original beneficiary as seller and the person acquiring the interest in the property as a result of the variation as buyer.

292,292,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2060 What is a cross-border transaction?," ‘Cross-border’ transactions involve:- 
 'Multiple property’ transactions 
 - the purchase of multiple property interests which falls within more than one tax jurisdiction, for a single agreed amount of consideration, whether in a single transaction or a series of associated transactions. Purchases of land in Wales on or after 1 April 2018 are not linked for tax purposes with any transaction elsewhere in the UK (or transactions in Wales made before 1 April 2018). For example the purchase of a shop in Cardiff, a shop in Edinburgh and a shop in Bristol as part of a single transaction or series of associated transactions will be a cross-border multiple property transaction because it includes property in 2 or more tax jurisdictions; 
 Single ‘cross-title’ property transactions 
 - the purchase of a single property interest that includes land on both sides of the Welsh-English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance) border, for example a field that is bisected by the border so that the land on each side of the border abuts and is contiguous with the land on the other side of the border. The property interest will often be represented by a single title registered at HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry). This subset of cross-border transactions will be referred to as cross-title transactions. 
 Tax treatment of cross-border transactions 
 For both types of cross-border transaction, the total consideration given must be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis

293,293,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2070 How to identify a cross-border transaction," For many transactions involving land in more than one tax jurisdiction it will be easily identifiable what land is in one jurisdiction and what land is in the other. In many cases separate titles will exist for the land in each jurisdiction. 
 In a small number of cases there will be a single property title that includes land on both sides of the Wales and England border. HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) official copies of title can assist customers to identify these cases. 
 Use this tool to check whether the postcode of land or property you’re buying or leasing is located in Wales(https://www.gov.wales/find-out-if-postcode-wales-land-transaction-tax) .

294,294,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2080 How to identify the border on HM Land Registry titles," The border may be shown on HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) title plans where the land is on the border or close to it. If so, it is shown as a broken and dotted line. The position of this line is not conclusive whether the land in the title falls in wholly or partly in England or Wales, its position in relation to the red edging on the title plan may be an indication. 
 There will, however, be a number of titles where the border is not marked on the title.  Where that title is a cross-title property it can be identified as such by the Part A property register annotation, which will include the following statement: ‘The land in this title may be located partly in England and partly in Wales’. In these cases it will be necessary for the taxpayer or their adviser to identify separately from the title where the border lies on a just and reasonable basis. For those close to the border but not crossing the border, the local authority code will assist in establishing the relevant tax jurisdiction. 
 In cases where the border is not marked on the title plan it will need to be identified from other geographical sources. 
 MapSearch 
 HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) Business e-service customers have access to a free MapSearch service, available through the HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) portal. It allows the user to: 
 
 find out whether a property is registered 
 view its location 
 obtain the title number 
 see the ownership of title 
 
 Users can find where the border falls on those titles where it is not marked. This will then allow the taxpayer to work out which return(s) are needed. The service can also help work out the apportionment of consideration for the land in England and in Wales, on a just and reasonable basis. 
 Different land plot locations 
 There are a small number of cross-border properties with separate areas of land that aren’t neighbouring. Such as where one area of land falls wholly in one country, and the second separate area, lies wholly in the other country. It’s important to find out if a cross-border property includes land split in this way. 
 There can be transactions where the property title is a distance from the border and the border isn’t shown. To help find the border and the tax jurisdiction(s) where the land is located, you can use: 
 
 evidence from the register of title 
 knowledge of the UK’s geography 
 local authority searches from planning applications 
 
 For those titles, close to the border but not crossing the border, the local authority code will help find the right tax jurisdiction.

295,295,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2090 Return obligations for cross-border transactions," The following assumes the apportioned consideration in respect of land in each jurisdiction is notifiable. 
 Consideration given for the totality of the title is usually the purchase price paid for the whole of transaction, not just the apportionment to Wales.  Where the land transaction includes a number of titles the consideration given should include all titles . including the total consideration given for any cross-title properties included in the transaction. 
 For a multiple property cross-border transaction, where there are separate properties in different tax jurisdictions, the total consideration will need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis and:  
 
 for land in England or Northern Ireland, a SDLT return will need to be made to HMRC, entering code 6996 instead of the local authority code; 
 for land in Wales an LTT return will need to be made to the WRA, entering the relevant Welsh local authority code for the land that is actually in Wales and also answering ‘yes’ to the multiple property cross-border question (the question applicable on the return is “Is this transaction part of a number of other transactions elsewhere in the UK, but outside Wales?”) and answering ‘no’ to the cross-title question on the return (“Is this a Wales-England cross-title transaction?”). 
 for land in Scotland - an LBTT return will need to be made to Revenue Scotland (RS) entering the relevant Scottish local authority answer ‘yes’ to the cross-border question 
 
 In respect of cross-title transactions (this is where the Welsh – English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance) border runs through the land in the transaction), then the consideration given for the land needs to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis for the purposes of the respective taxes, and: 
 
 for land in England a SDLT return will need to be made to HMRC, entering code 6997 instead of the local authority code; 
 for land in Wales a LTT return will need to be made to the WRA, entering the relevant Welsh local authority name for the land that is actually in Wales and also answering ‘no’ to the multiple property cross-border question (“Is this transaction part of a number of other transactions elsewhere in the UK, but outside Wales?”) and ‘yes’ to the cross-title question on the return (“Is this a Wales-England cross-title transaction?”).  
 
 Where the land is registered on a single title crossing the Welsh/ English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance) border, 2 returns will need to be made, one to HMRC and one to the WRA if those respective land transactions are both notifiable. However, a single application will need to be made to HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) to register the single title for the land in Wales and in England. 
 Transactions that include land on either side of a border are not linked for the purposes of the respective linked transaction rules in LTT, SDLT and LBTT. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance
296,296,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2100 Apportionment of consideration," The total consideration given for a cross-border transaction must be apportioned on a ‘just and reasonable’ basis to arrive at the consideration relating to the land in each tax jurisdiction. 
 The taxpayer is under an obligation to split the consideration given, based on the relative value of the land that falls into each tax jurisdiction. 
 The apportionment may be undertaken by an independent person qualified to make such a valuation or the taxpayer themselves, based on the relevant facts of the transaction. What would not be a just and reasonable apportionment would be for the taxpayer to make a guess at what might be the right figure. 
 Also the taxpayer cannot simply rely on a contract or agreement that seeks to apportion the consideration between the land in different jurisdictions if this does not reflect the relevant facts of the transaction. 
 The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) website provides some helpful guidance, (although it is in relation to capital gains tax), for what factors should be considered when apportioning value or consideration between different elements of the land. 
 The VOA guidance in relation to cases where there is a claim to private residence relief (particularly part 6 (paragraphs 8.60 - 8.64)) is helpful, see  8.61 Interpretation of ""Just and Reasonable"" Method(https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-gains-and-other-taxes-manual/section-8#default-id-9d1d7736-heading-8) . 
 The same principles established here are relevant for all such apportionments required for cross-border transactions for LTT and SDLT. 
 As noted in the VOA guidance, simply using the area of land on the title and apportioning the consideration given between land in the different tax jurisdictions may not result in a just and reasonable apportionment. It may be appropriate for a field with no buildings where there is little difference in value between the land in Wales and the land in England. However, when there are buildings on the land, then clearly that part of the land with a building on it is likely to have more value than land without a building upon it. Such an approach will also be relevant where there is a part of a building in one jurisdiction and the other part is in the other jurisdiction. The building, its condition and the use to which it is (and can be) put will be relevant in apportioning the consideration. 
 The following examples have been developed in collaboration with the VOA and are intended to highlight the types of issues that may need to be take account of in establishing a just and reasonable apportionment, and illustrate why the facts in each case are relevant to the apportionment. People seeking more information on valuations are encouraged to visit the VOA website. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A farm is being acquired by Mr and Mrs A. It consists of 20 different fields, some of which include the farmhouse and various agricultural buildings. 8 of the fields are for land wholly in Wales and 9 are for land wholly in England. The remaining 3 fall both in Wales and England. The transaction is therefore a cross-border transaction that includes land that meets the description in both – cross-border portfolio and cross border cross-title transactions. The consideration given for the transaction will need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis between that given for the land in Wales and that for the land in England. This apportionment will need to take into account where any buildings are located and the nature of those buildings. It may also be that some parts of the land may be more valuable because of their location, access, use or development (e.g. drainage) and these distinctions will need to be reflected in the apportionment. If the contract contains details of how the consideration given for the land in Wales and the land in England is to be split that apportionment should only be used if it is a just and reasonable apportionment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 A single property where the whole of a house and the majority of the garden is in Wales (total 50% of the land area of the interest transferred) and the rest of the garden (representing 50% of land area of the interest transferred) is in England. The property therefore is a cross border cross-title transaction). On these facts a just and reasonable apportionment may not (unless there were exceptional reasons) simply be 50% of the consideration returned in Wales and 50% in England. This is because the consideration given for the land in Wales must include not only the land itself but also the just and reasonable amount of the consideration given for the house as well. 
 A just and reasonable apportionment might be determined by establishing what the property would have cost without the part of the garden in England. A chartered surveyor or estate agent may be able to provide a just and reasonable amount that the area of the garden in England alone adds to the consideration given for the property in total. The chartered surveyor or estate agent may consider that with the garden, the property would have a market value of £300,000 but without the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ garden, the market value would have been £280,000. The just and reasonable apportionment of the consideration actually given on this basis, for the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ garden will be ((300,000-280,000)/300,000) x 100 = 6.67%. The actual consideration given for the title was £290,000. Using the just and reasonable apportionment established the consideration that will need to be returned for land transaction tax purposes is £270,657 (£290,000 x 93.33%) and the consideration appropriate for the SDLT return is £19,343 (£290,000 x 6.67%). As the amount relevant for SDLT is below the current (as at April 2018) notification limit, a return does not need to be made to HMRC (subject to the transaction not being linked to other transaction(s) that would make the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ transaction notifiable). 
 Apportionments that are intended to minimise tax or return obligations will not be just and reasonable apportionments. Using XX5, a professional valuer may establish that more than 50% of the land value is in Wales, because the house is located on that side of the border. However if the taxpayer were to split the consideration equally so that half is returned to both WRA and HMRC to maximise the use of the zero rate bands in both tax regimes – and the facts did not lend themselves to such a split – that will not be just and reasonable and may lead to penalties being imposed. 
 Similarly, where the amount of consideration given is notifiable to one of the tax authorities and is less than or marginally higher than the relevant notification level (£40,000 for both taxes where what is bought is a major interest) then simply using the figure of £40,000 is not acceptable either, because it potentially results in a tax underpayment in the other tax regime, or, because it avoids a filing obligation to one of the tax authorities. Where a return obligation is avoided by reducing the consideration returnable to either WRA or HMRC then late filing penalties may arise if that return is, following enquiry, made late (WRA and SDLT/HMRC inaccuracy penalties pages). 
 Finally, it is important to note that the amounts established by the just and reasonable apportionment must in total equal the amount of consideration actually given (or in the case where a market value must be used, that market value), and that a consistent basis of valuation applied to each part of the land transaction that falls into each tax jurisdiction. For example, if the apportionment is established using an open market value for the Welsh and the English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance) land (of, say £200,000 and £50,000 respectively) but the consideration given is £270,000 (that is £20,000 more than the respective open market valuations) then the consideration returned on the two returns must equal £270,000. An apportionment of £216,000 and £54,000 (a total of £270,000) would be just and reasonable as it reflects the 80/20 split of the open market value of the land in Wales and in England. However, returning just £200,000 and £50,000 to the 2 tax authorities is not acceptable (except in specific cases where an open market value must be used for example the deemed market value rules that apply to cases where the buyer is a company and the seller is connected to the company).

The transaction is therefore a cross-border transaction that includes land that meets the description in both – cross-border portfolio and cross border cross-title transactions. The consideration given for the transaction will need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis between that given for the land in Wales and that for the land in England. This apportionment will need to take into account where any buildings are located and the nature of those buildings. It may also be that some parts of the land may be more valuable because of their location, access, use or development (e.g. drainage) and these distinctions will need to be reflected in the apportionment. If the contract contains details of how the consideration given for the land in Wales and the land in England is to be split that apportionment should only be used if it is a just and reasonable apportionment.

 Example 2 
 
 
   
 A single property where the whole of a house and the majority of the garden is in Wales (total 50% of the land area of the interest transferred) and the rest of the garden (representing 50% of land area of the interest transferred) is in England. The property therefore is a cross border cross-title transaction). On these facts a just and reasonable apportionment may not (unless there were exceptional reasons) simply be 50% of the consideration returned in Wales and 50% in England. This is because the consideration given for the land in Wales must include not only the land itself but also the just and reasonable amount of the consideration given for the house as well. 
 A just and reasonable apportionment might be determined by establishing what the property would have cost without the part of the garden in England. A chartered surveyor or estate agent may be able to provide a just and reasonable amount that the area of the garden in England alone adds to the consideration given for the property in total. The chartered surveyor or estate agent may consider that with the garden, the property would have a market value of £300,000 but without the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ garden, the market value would have been £280,000. The just and reasonable apportionment of the consideration actually given on this basis, for the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ garden will be ((300,000-280,000)/300,000) x 100 = 6.67%. The actual consideration given for the title was £290,000. Using the just and reasonable apportionment established the consideration that will need to be returned for land transaction tax purposes is £270,657 (£290,000 x 93.33%) and the consideration appropriate for the SDLT return is £19,343 (£290,000 x 6.67%). As the amount relevant for SDLT is below the current (as at April 2018) notification limit, a return does not need to be made to HMRC (subject to the transaction not being linked to other transaction(s) that would make the ‘English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance)’ transaction notifiable). 
 Apportionments that are intended to minimise tax or return obligations will not be just and reasonable apportionments. Using XX5, a professional valuer may establish that more than 50% of the land value is in Wales, because the house is located on that side of the border. However if the taxpayer were to split the consideration equally so that half is returned to both WRA and HMRC to maximise the use of the zero rate bands in both tax regimes – and the facts did not lend themselves to such a split – that will not be just and reasonable and may lead to penalties being imposed. 
 Similarly, where the amount of consideration given is notifiable to one of the tax authorities and is less than or marginally higher than the relevant notification level (£40,000 for both taxes where what is bought is a major interest) then simply using the figure of £40,000 is not acceptable either, because it potentially results in a tax underpayment in the other tax regime, or, because it avoids a filing obligation to one of the tax authorities. Where a return obligation is avoided by reducing the consideration returnable to either WRA or HMRC then late filing penalties may arise if that return is, following enquiry, made late (WRA and SDLT/HMRC inaccuracy penalties pages). 
 Finally, it is important to note that the amounts established by the just and reasonable apportionment must in total equal the amount of consideration actually given (or in the case where a market value must be used, that market value), and that a consistent basis of valuation applied to each part of the land transaction that falls into each tax jurisdiction. For example, if the apportionment is established using an open market value for the Welsh and the English(https://www.gov.wales/cross-border-and-cross-title-transactions-technical-guidance) land (of, say £200,000 and £50,000 respectively) but the consideration given is £270,000 (that is £20,000 more than the respective open market valuations) then the consideration returned on the two returns must equal £270,000. An apportionment of £216,000 and £54,000 (a total of £270,000) would be just and reasonable as it reflects the 80/20 split of the open market value of the land in Wales and in England. However, returning just £200,000 and £50,000 to the 2 tax authorities is not acceptable (except in specific cases where an open market value must be used for example the deemed market value rules that apply to cases where the buyer is a company and the seller is connected to the company).

297,297,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2110 Enquiries into a taxpayer’s just and reasonable apportionment," Where a taxpayer is required to make a just and reasonable apportionment of the consideration paid between land in Wales and land in England or elsewhere, under the normal rules for opening enquiries or making determinations or discovery assessments, the WRA, HMRC or Revenue Scotland may challenge the return made to them. In challenging the return made, the WRA will endeavour to reach an agreement on the apportionment with other tax authorities, in conjunction with the taxpayer. 
 The enquiry will look at the apportionment of the consideration to establish the basis on which the apportionment was made. If the evidence of the just and reasonable apportionment used is absent or appears to be unreasonable, it is possible that the tax authority which opened the enquiry will ask the VOA to establish the just and reasonable apportionment of the consideration for the respective returns. If this occurs, the WRA, HMRC and Revenue Scotland will accept the decision of the VOA. 
 Either tax authority can ask the VOA to provide either a non-negotiated apportionment or a negotiated apportionment. 
 Where a taxpayer’s apportionment is accepted, the enquiry will be closed and no further action will be required. 
 Where the non-negotiated apportionment differs from the taxpayer’s and the tax authority that has opened the enquiry decides that it will not pursue the matter (perhaps because the difference in apportionment results in only a marginal adjustment to the consideration returnable or tax payable) it may decide to conclude the enquiry by accepting the taxpayer’s apportionment. Where the adjustment is material, the relevant tax authority will seek the taxpayer’s agreement to the proposed just and reasonable apportionment amounts. 
 Where a negotiated apportionment has been established, the enquiry should be settled on this basis (the apportionment having been agreed by both the VOA and the taxpayer). 
 There may be cases where the taxpayer and the tax authority cannot settle the case by agreement because they cannot agree the just and reasonable apportionment. In such cases, the enquiry will be closed based on the VOA apportionment. The taxpayer may choose to exercise their right of review or appeal.  During any appeal, the question of apportionment may need to be referred to the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) by the First Tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal (Tax Chamber). Once the appropriate apportionment has been determined then the appeal will return to the Tax Tribunal if prior agreement between the taxpayer and the relevant tax authority is not reached. 
 Where additional tax is payable as a result of the enquiry and the original apportionment of the consideration given is not found to be just and reasonable, a penalty may be sought due to the inaccuracy made in the return. 
 When the tax liability for the return that was enquired into is final, the taxpayer will be able to adjust the consideration payable by amendment to the tax return for the other tax jurisdiction (if within the time limits imposed for such amendments to returns in the respective regimes). Alternatively, the taxpayer may make a claim to the ‘non-enquiring’ tax authority to obtain a repayment if appropriate under section 63 of TCMA 2016 for land transaction tax or paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2003 (‘FA 2003’) for SDLT. When making a claim, the taxpayer should include the letter that closed the enquiry, settled the appeal by agreement, or sets out the decision of the Tax Tribunal. 
 However, the taxpayer will still need to comply with the requirements of section 67 TCMA 2016 and paragraph 34A of Schedule 10 to the FA 2003. In particular, Case2/Case B and Case 3/Case C should be considered: 
 
 Case 2/Case B ensure that a taxpayer should amend their return if possible before making a claim under these provisions, and 
 Case 3/Case C will result in a refusal to make the refund if the taxpayer has delayed making their claim when they had time to make an amendment to their return. 
 
 In relation to Case 3/Case C situations, both the WRA and HMRC will consider that where a taxpayer makes a claim within 3 months of the closing of the enquiry by the other tax authority that the claim has been made in an appropriate time frame and it will not be refused.

298,298,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Cross-border and cross-title transactions,LTTA/2120 Registration of title at the Land Registries," Ownership of land and property in England and Wales is registered by the  HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) . 
 Ownership of land and property in Scotland is registered by  Registers of Scotland(https://www.ros.gov.uk/) . 
 Ownership of land and property in Northern Ireland is registered by  Land and Property Services(https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/land-property-services-lps) . 
 In all cases, registration for notifiable transactions is subject to confirmation that a SDLT/ LTT/ LBTT return has been made as appropriate to the relevant tax authority in respect of the transaction. 
 For transactions on or after 1st April 2018 that include land in England and Wales, the taxpayer will still be able to make a single application for registration to HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry). Any single application will need to include, where both transactions are notifiable to the respective tax jurisdictions, evidence, in the form of both a LTT certificate and a SDLT certificate, that the respective returns have been made. 
 There will be cases where the cross-border transaction will include land in Wales or England that is not notifiable to either WRA or HMRC (or potentially both). In these cases it will be necessary for the taxpayer to notify HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) when sending in the relevant transfer form(s) that there is only one certificate (or no certificates) because the consideration given for the land in one country, or in both tax jurisdictions, is not notifiable to one, or both, tax jurisdiction. 
 There are some registered titles (about 1,000) which are partly in England and partly in Wales. Approximately half of these cross-border titles include only a very small part of land in one country with the vast majority of the land located in the other (perhaps due to mapping tolerances). In these cases, consideration should be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis as usual. If on this basis the consideration for the minor part is found to be negligible or below notification limits, then HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) should be advised as for any other land transaction that is not notifiable for SDLT or LTT purposes. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A taxpayer buys half a hectare of bare land with hope value that a planning application for a change of use from agricultural use to residential use will be successful. The agricultural land value is £10,000. However, with the hope of a successful planning application, the consideration given is £200,000. The title document shows that approximately 1% of the land (by area and value) falls into Wales. If the land in Wales is separated from the main part of the land, perhaps by a stream that is the border, it may, on a just and reasonable basis, be that the value of the land in Wales is negligible as it is a very small parcel of land which is separated from the bulk of the land by water and not accessible by land above water which is under common ownership (or that is to be acquired). In this example the HM Land Registry(https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry) transfer document will need to be accompanied by the SDLT5 certificate and a letter explaining that on the basis of just and reasonable apportionment, the consideration for the Welsh element of the land transaction is negligible and was not notifiable in Wales, therefore there is no WRA certificate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 A taxpayer buys land registered on a single title that amounts to 200 hectares. 1% of the land is in Wales. In this case, whilst the amount of land in Wales is only 1% and therefore small in relative terms the actual land in Wales is significant in absolute terms – equating to 2 hectares. The consideration given for the land will need to be apportioned between Wales and England on a just and reasonable basis. Whether the transaction needs to be notified for LTT will depend on the amount of consideration apportioned to Wales. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 The situation is similar to example 1, however, the amount of consideration given is not for hope value but for the fishing rights that are acquired with the land. The fishing rights apply to both sides of the stream. In this case whilst only a small part of the land is in Wales it is of near equal value to the land in England due to the banks of the stream on each side having fishing rights. Assuming the stream’s banks are of equal length (and the fishing rights match that length) the consideration will need to be split more equally than is reflected solely when comparing the land in each tax jurisdiction. Both SDLT and LTT returns will be required if the consideration apportioned to each part of the land is above notification limits and the relevant certificates will need to be produced to Land Registry for both applications.

In this case whilst only a small part of the land is in Wales it is of near equal value to the land in England due to the banks of the stream on each side having fishing rights. Assuming the stream’s banks are of equal length (and the fishing rights match that length) the consideration will need to be split more equally than is reflected solely when comparing the land in each tax jurisdiction. Both SDLT and LTT returns will be required if the consideration apportioned to each part of the land is above notification limits and the relevant certificates will need to be produced to Land Registry for both applications.

300,300,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2130 Contract and transfer," (section 10) 
 When a contract is completed or substantially performed there will be a land transaction and the buyer may need to make a return if the transaction is notifiable, and may need to pay land transaction tax if the transaction is a chargeable transaction. A person is not considered to have entered into a land transaction if they have only entered into a contract. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/particular-transactions-technical-guidance
301,301,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2140 Contract completed without previous substantial performance," Where a contract is completed without prior substantial performance, the contract and the completion of that transaction are parts of the same single land transaction. The effective date for the land transaction is the date of completion. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/particular-transactions-technical-guidance
302,302,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2150 Substantial performance," Where a contract is substantially performed without having been completed, the contract is treated as if it were the transaction and the effective date of the transaction is the date the contract is substantially performed. 
 When substantial performance occurs 
 A contract will be substantially performed when: 
 
 the buyer, or a person connected to them, takes possession of the whole or substantially the whole of the subject matter of the contract; or 
 a substantial amount of the consideration is paid or provided 
 
 Possession of the subject matter includes the buyer, or a person connected to them, having the right to receive, or actual receipt of, rents and profits from the property. Substantial performance through the taking of possession will occur whether it occurs as a result of the contract or under a licence, temporary lease or a tenancy at will. 
 Where there is no rent as part of the consideration, a substantial amount of the consideration is paid when the whole or substantially the whole of the consideration is paid or provided. 
 Where the only consideration is rent, a substantial amount of the consideration is paid when the first payment of rent is made. 
 Where the consideration includes both rent and consideration other than rent, substantial performance will occur at the earliest of: 
 
 when the whole or substantially the whole of the consideration is paid or provided; or 
 the first payment of rent is made 
 
 Where the consideration is other than rent, substantially ‘the whole’ means an amount equal to or greater than 90% of the total consideration due under the contract, unless the circumstances of the transaction are such that in substance the whole of the consideration has been paid or provided. 
 In the event that the buyer already has occupation of the premises under a different interest, for example when the purchase is of a freehold and the purchaser is a tenant, substantial performance on the basis of possession will not be triggered at the time of the contract as long as the purchaser adheres to the covenants in the lease. However, depending upon the facts, it may still be possible for the taxpayer to trigger substantial performance by payment of substantially all of the consideration. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A has entered a contract to buy a property. When contracts are entered into he pays a deposit of 20% of the consideration This will not represent substantial performance. The contract is to be completed on 30 April 2020. On 1 December 2019 Mr A pays a further 70% of the consideration to the seller. He has now paid substantially the whole of the consideration and has therefore substantially performed the contract (even though he has not been given possession of the property). The effective date of the transaction is 1 December 2019 and a return will need to be made by 31 December 2019. On completion of the contract (30 April 2020) another return will need to be made. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is allowed into possession in order to fit out a shop prior to commencing trading. The agreement with the landlord is that while the agreed lease start date is later, B Ltd may enter the property earlier to fit it out. The landlord however, wants a pro rata payment of the rent to be made on the date that B Ltd is first permitted access to the shop. The first payment of rent will be the substantial performance of that lease. 
 Alternatively, if the consideration was to be paid only by consideration other than rent and the seller allowed B Ltd to carry out fitting out works for the 2 months before the transaction completes, the right to occupy and use of the shop amounts to substantial performance of the contract. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Y Ltd enters into a contract to acquire land from W Ltd which it is to develop into a light industrial park. The area of the land is 3 hectares, and the price set in the contract is £1,200,000, with the contract signed on 1 July 2020 and a completion date of 30 June 2022. Each part of the land is of equal value. The completion date has been fixed at relatively far into the future because W Ltd has granted a lease over 2 hectares of the land to a camping site that has a termination date of 31 December 2021. 
 W Ltd agrees to let Y Ltd access on 1 July 2020 to the one hectare that is not leased so that it can start preparatory work. As the land is of equal value, and Y Ltd has only been given access to a third of the land, it has not taken possession of substantially the whole of the land. The contract has not therefore been substantially completed. 
 The owner of the campsite on land leased from W Ltd becomes ill and from 1 September 2020 is unable to run the campsite any longer. W Ltd, which has had a very positive relationship with the owner of the campsite, agrees to the immediate surrender of the lease for no consideration, and also allows the owner of the campsite to remain in occupation (under a licence) of the campsite operator‘s house and gardens, specifying that it must be vacated by 31 December 2021. 
 Y Ltd asks, on 1 January 2022, to be allowed access to the other 2 hectares (other than the operator‘s house and gardens). W Ltd agrees to this request, and W Ltd takes possession of the remaining 2 hectares (except the house) on 1 March 2022. At this point, W Ltd as taken possession of substantially the whole of the land and has therefore the contract has been substantially performed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 T Ltd enters into a contract to acquire a building from U Ltd. The property has a market value of £10m. The purchase price is to be met, as set out in a contract dated 5 January 2020, by the payment of £15m. That amount is to be paid in 2 tranches, £10m payable on 5 January 2020 and the balance in 2150. The WRA will consider that in such a case that the contract has been substantially performed as, whilst there remains a third of the consideration to be paid, that payment date is so far into the future that substantially all of the consideration has been given. The consideration for the transaction remains £15m, the amount in the contract. 
 In this example, it is also possible that T Ltd will have taken possession of the property as well. Therefore, it could have substantially performed the contract under those rules.

303,303,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2160 Substantial performance - Completion of contract following substantial performance," Where a transaction has been substantially performed and is subsequently completed, both the substantial performance of the contract and the completion of the contract can be notifiable transactions. 
 Where the tax charged on the completion of the contract is higher than the amount of tax chargeable on the substantial performance of the contract, the additional amount must be included in the self-assessment for that return. The return for both the substantial performance of the contract and the return for the completion of the transaction must show the full amount of consideration payable, known at the date each return is completed.

304,304,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2170 Substantial performance – contract not carried into effect," Following the substantial performance of a contract, it is possible that the contract will (in whole or part) be rescinded, annulled, or for any other reason not carried into effect. If this occurs, the WRA will pay back the tax paid (or the appropriate amount of the tax) if an amended return is made by the taxpayer reflecting the effect of the rescinding etc. of the contract (or part of the contract). 
 Repayment can only be achieved through the submission of an amended return. An amended return can only be made during the period of 12 months beginning with the filing date for the return that has been impacted by the rescinding etc. of the contract. 
 The consequence of this rule is that the taxpayer has only the 12 months from the filing date for the substantial performance of the contract. That is 12 months and 30 days from the effective date of the transaction. If the contract is rescinded outside this period, the taxpayer will not be able to amend their return and will not be able to claim a repayment.

305,305,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2180 Contract providing for transfer to third party," (section 11) 
 Where a contract is entered into that requires one party to the contract (P2), the right to direct or request the seller (P1) to transfer the subject matter of the contract to themselves or to a third party (P3),the following rules apply: 
 
 P2 is not treated as entering into a land transaction as a result of entering into the contract; 
 if the chargeable interest is transferred to P3 at P2’s direction, without substantial performance of the contract by P2 having occurred before that transfer, then there is only one land transaction, that between P1 to P3; 
 if the chargeable interest is transferred to P2, the usual rules relating to contract and transfer apply; 
 the usual rules also apply in relation to any contract between P2 and P3; 
 if the contract is substantially performed by P2, even if the contract is subsequently completed by the transfer of the chargeable interest from P1 to P3, P2 is treated as having acquired a chargeable interest and entered into a land transaction. The effective date of that transaction is the date of substantial performance 
 
 In the event that, following substantial performance of the contract by P2, the contract is rescinded, annulled or otherwise not carried into effect, repayment of tax may be possible. 
 An example of this is a development agreement where the developer has the right to enter onto the land and build on it and then direct the conveyance of the completed plots. In this case, the effective date of the transaction is the date when the contract is substantially performed by P2; when P2 took possession of the property in order to develop it. There will therefore be two LTT liabilities arising; one on the substantial performance of the contract by P2 and a second on the conveyance to the third party end buyer. 
 Where P2 directs the original seller (P1) to transfer a plot (or the whole of the property) to P3, the rules above about ‘contract and conveyance’, ‘completion without substantial performance’ and ‘substantial performance without completion’ apply to the contract between P2 and P3 and to the conveyance from P1 to P3. The result is that P3 is liable to pay LTT on the consideration paid to P1 or P2, either on completion or on substantial performance of their contract. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 B Ltd (P2) enters into a contract to purchase a property from A Ltd (P1). The contract includes a clause that permits B Ltd to direct A Ltd to transfer the property to a third party. B Ltd pays A Ltd 100% of the agreed purchase price (£2,000,000) and has therefore substantially performed the contract and must make a return to the WRA within 30 days following the substantial performance of the contract. B Ltd then develops the land into a shopping centre. When the shopping centre is complete B Ltd sells the centre to C Ltd (P3) by separate contract for £6,000,000. B Ltd instructs A Ltd to transfer the property to C Ltd. C Ltd’s return (with B Ltd as seller) will show the consideration of £6,000,000. C Ltd will also complete the sale from A Ltd showing itself as buyer as B Ltd has not completed the transfer of the property to itself.

306,306,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2190 Contract providing for transfer to third party: effect of transfer of rights," (section 12) 
 These rules complement the rules for a contract providing for transfer to third party.  
 If a contract provides for the subject matter to be transferred from the seller (P1) to a third party (P3) at the direction of the buyer (P2) but the rights of that buyer become exercisable by another person (P4) then: 
 
 P4 is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the transfer of rights; 
 the transfer of rights is treated as a separate (‘secondary’) contract; 
 P4 is treated as though they were the buyer (P2) under the original contract; 
 the consideration due from P4 under the secondary contract is; the consideration under the original contract that relates to the subject matter of the transfer of rights that is to be given by P4 (or a person connected to them), and, the consideration for the transfer of rights 
 
 If the original contract has been substantially performed by P2 then that substantial performance is disregarded (that is to say that P2 is not liable to the return obligations arising from the substantial performance) if it occurs: 
 
 at the same time as, and in connection with, the substantial performance of the secondary contract; or, 
 after the transfer of rights to P4. 
 
 If there are a number of successive transfers of rights, the rules are applied to each of those transfers of rights separately. As such the substantial performance of a secondary contract related to an earlier transfer of rights is to be disregarded if it occurs: 
 
 at the same time as and in connection with the substantial performance of the secondary contract arising from a subsequent transfer of rights; or, 
 after that subsequent transfer 
 
 If the transfer of rights relates to only part of the subject matter of the original contract, or only to some of the rights under that contract then: 
 
 the rules apply only in relation to that part of the subject matter or those rights; and, 
 the contract relating to the other part or rights is treated as a separate contract 
 
 The effective date of a land transaction arising on a secondary contract cannot be earlier than the date of the assignment etc. that resulted in the transfer of rights to P4.

307,307,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2200 Pre-completion transactions," (section 13 and Schedule 2) 
 The starting point for a pre-completion transaction is that there must be a contract for a land transaction which is to be completed by a transfer. Before that ‘original contract’ is substantially performed or completed, the buyer under that contract may enter into a further agreement as a result of which another person is entitled to call for the transfer of all or part of the subject-matter of the original contract. Such an agreement is a pre-completion transaction. 
 In the context of a pre-completion transaction, the buyer under the original contract is sometimes called ‘the transferor’ and the ultimate buyer ‘the transferee’. 
 This is a complex area of LTT and the guidance therefore makes specific reference to the relevant legislation. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/particular-transactions-technical-guidance
308,308,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2210 Outline of legislation," Section 13 introduces Schedule 2 which contains provisions about pre-completion transactions. Unless otherwise specified, references to paragraphs in this guidance are to paragraphs of Schedule 2. The Schedule can be broken down into the following different areas.

 Interpretation 
 
 
 
 Introductory provisions and key definitions 
 Paragraphs 1-5 
 These paragraphs define a pre-completion transaction and make a distinction between assignments of rights and other pre-completion transactions (known as free-standing transfers). They also state that the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason only of the pre-completion transaction. 
 Assignments of rights 
 Paragraphs 6-11 
 Paragraph 7 outlines how the transferee is treated in these cases. Broadly, the consideration for the transferee’s acquisition is whatever the transferee gives under the original contract, plus whatever the transferee gives for the assignment of rights. 
 The seller for the transferee’s acquisition is generally the original seller under the original contract, although there are exceptions to this general rule (see paragraph 11). 
 Paragraph 8 creates a ‘notional land transaction’ for the transferor under an assignment of rights (sub-paragraph 8(1)). If there are successive assignments, then there is also a notional ‘additional land transaction’ for each additional subsequent transferor in the chain (sub-paragraph 8(3)). Broadly, the consideration for a notional land transaction is any consideration given under the original contract by either the transferee or the transferor. For an additional land transaction, any consideration given by the buyer under the additional land transaction for the preceding assignment is also brought into charge. 
 Where the original contract is substantially performed but subsequently rescinded or annulled, the transferee’s position will be covered by the normal rules. Similar provision is made in paragraph 9 for a notional or additional land transaction within paragraph 8. 
 An assignment of rights may relate to only part of the land that is the subject-matter of the original contract. In such a case, paragraphs 7 and 8 apply as if the original contract were split into two contracts: one for the land that is subject to the assignment and one for the rest of the land (paragraph 10). 
 Free-standing transfers 
 Paragraphs 12-13 
 Paragraph 13 concerns the transferee. It adds any consideration given for the pre-completion transaction to the consideration otherwise given by the transferee. As for assignments of rights, the seller for the transferee’s acquisition is generally the original seller. 
 No special provision is made for the transferor. If the free-standing transfer is a sub-sale, then the original contract will be completed (or substantially performed) so the transferor will be the buyer under a land transaction as normal under the rules relating to contract and transfer. If the free-standing transfer is a novation, then there is no land transaction under which the transferor is the buyer, so the transferor has no need to file a return or claim relief. 
 The seller in linked transactions 
 Paragraph 14 
 Whether the transferee’s acquisition falls under the rules for an assignment of rights (paragraphs 6 – 11) or free-standing transfers (paragraphs 12 – 13) the seller will usually be the original seller, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Once the subject matter of the original contract has been transferred to the transferee (or in the case of an assignment of rights, once the original contract has been substantially performed) for the purposes of the linked transaction rules (section 8(1) of LTTA) the seller can be assumed to be both the seller in the original transaction, and any transferor in one or more pre-completion transactions relating to it. This will generally mean that, if the transferor and transferee are connected persons, then the linked transaction rules will apply to the original transaction and pre-completion transaction relating to it. Example 5, in section LTTA/2230 below, illustrates how this operates in practice. 
 Minimum consideration rule 
 Paragraphs 15-17 
 The minimum consideration rule only applies where the ultimate buyer is either connected with, or not acting at arm’s length from, the transferor (or any other preceding transferor where there are successive pre-completion transactions). It can be ignored for all other transactions. 
 Where the rule applies, it can increase the consideration for the ultimate buyer’s acquisition. If either of 2 ‘minimum amounts’ is higher than the amount of consideration given by the normal rules, the consideration is increased to the higher minimum amount. 
 The first minimum amount is generally the amount due under original contract. The second minimum amount is given by a formula which includes the net amount given by each party (subject to certain exceptions) to the transactions. 
 Relief for the transferor 
 Paragraphs 1-20 
 The transferor can claim full relief for its land transaction in certain circumstances. For relief to be available, the pre-completion transaction must be an assignment of rights or a sub-sale. There are separate reliefs for assignments (paragraph 18) and for sub-sales (paragraph 19). For a sub-sale, the original contract must be substantially performed or completed at the same time as and in connection with the substantial performance or completion of the sub-sale contract. Partial relief is available where the assignment or sub-sale relates to only part of the land that is the subject of the original contract. Relief must be claimed in a land transaction return, or an amendment to such a return. Please select the appropriate relief on the LTT return. 
  
Relief is barred where the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule applies.

309,309,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2220 Registration of interest in land," A taxpayer is prevented from registering land acquired in most notifiable land transactions unless the person applying to have their interest registered produces a WRA certificate to HM Land Registry showing they have met their LTT obligations. 
 In a sub-sale, there will generally be 2 transfers of the land: A to B and B to C. 
 If B wishes to register its interest in the land, it will need to produce a WRA certificate together with its application for registration and the transfer from A to B, in the normal way. 
 If B does not wish to register its interest in the land, C will need to produce C’s WRA certificate, its application for registration and the transfers from A to B and B to C. With its application for registration, C should also either: 
 
 Confirm in writing that B acquired the land from A and transferred it to C in pursuance of a ‘free-standing transfer’ for the purposes of Schedule 2 to the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017; or 
 Produce written confirmation from B (or B’s agent) that B acquired the land from A and transferred it to C in pursuance of a ‘free-standing transfer’ for the purposes of Schedule 2 to the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017. 
 
 If there is only one transfer of the land – A to C – then C will only need to produce its WRA certificate, its application for registration and the transfer from A to C. 
 In an assignment of rights, there will be just one transfer of the land: A to C. In this case, C can register its interest in the normal way. The notional land transaction between A and B is notifiable for LTT purposes even though it is not an acquisition of a major or chargeable interest. There is no need for a letter confirming an assignment of rights. Only C’s WRA certificate is needed.

 Example 1 - Simple assignments of rights 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B assigns its rights under the contract to C for a payment of £100,000. 
 C completes the acquisition and pays A £1m. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £1.1m. 
 The transactions fall within Schedule 2 in the following way: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction in paragraphs 2 and 3; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’ that falls within paragraph 6; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction (paragraph 5) 
 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
 C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is established in line with the rules in Schedule 4. The result is that both the £1m given to A and the £100,000 given to B are included – total £1.1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A; the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 The position of the transferor, B, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction; 
 The chargeable consideration for the notional land transaction is the total of amount A and amount B. Amount A is £1m as that is the consideration given by C to A under the original contract. Amount B is nil as there was no other consideration given under the original contract, so the chargeable consideration for taxpayer B is £1m; 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 - Sub-sale and minimum consideration rule 
 
 
   
 This is an example of a sub-sale. It also illustrates how the minimum consideration rule works where parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land for consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B enters into a sale and purchase agreement for the same land with C for consideration of £900,000 payable on completion. 
 At a single completion meeting the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £900,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 If B and C are unconnected and acting at arm’s length, then B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £900,000. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction that is a free-standing transfer; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so the rules concerning a free-standing transfer apply; 
 in the absence of any special provision, B is regarded as entering into a land transaction with A for consideration of £1m (the amount in the original contract); 
 the pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale and meets the relevant conditions set out for relief for qualifying sub-sales. So B can claim relief (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR) 
 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £900,000 paid by C to B in the normal way. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
  
If B and C were connected, C’s acquisition would be subject to the minimum consideration rule – paragraphs 15-17 – with the intended outcome that the chargeable consideration should be increased from £900,000 to £1m. 
 The consideration for C’s acquisition is taken to be the greatest of three amounts: either the £900,000 already determined above (i.e. what C paid to A) or the first minimum amount or the second minimum amount. 
 The first minimum amount is defined in paragraph 16(2) and (3). In this case it is the £1m that was due under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is set out in paragraph 17 and is the total of the net amounts of consideration (as determined in sub-paragraph 17(2)) given by the relevant parties (as per sub-paragraph 17(3)) and subject to sub-paragraph 17(4)). In this case, B and C are the relevant parties. The net amount of consideration given by C is £900,000. The net amount of consideration given by B is £100,000 (that is, the £1m given to A less the £900,000 received from C). So the total of the net amounts of consideration is £1m. 
 The result is that the consideration for C’s acquisition is £1m – the greatest amount out of £900,000, £1m and £1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 This means that the transactions described in this example will be linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of the act. For an example of how this works in practice, see example 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 - Assignment of part 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B assigns its rights to Plot 2 under the contract to C. 
 C completes the acquisition of Plot 2 and pays A £400,000. 
 B completes the acquisition of Plot 1 and pays A £600,000. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £400,000 in respect of Plot 2 but can include a claim for full relief of the tax arising on that amount of consideration. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £400,000. B must also make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £600,000 in respect of Plot 1. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 as there is an assignment of rights relating to only a part of the original contract, paragraph 10 ensures that the rules are to be operated as though there was a separate original contract for Plot 2 
 
 The transferee, C, completes their return and pays tax on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2. 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The £600,000 given by B on completion of the acquisition of Plot 1 is regarded as given under a different contract. C’s return will show themselves as buyer and A as seller with just the £400,000 given by C on completion as the chargeable consideration. 
  
The position of the transferor, B, on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2 and relief being available, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction. 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s acquisition is dealt with in paragraph 8(6)(a). That consideration is £400,000 as that is the consideration given by C to A in respect of the subject matter of the original contract. 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 This leaves the acquisition of Plot 1 by B. The facts are that B has entered into a land transaction with chargeable consideration of the £600,000 that B gives to acquire Plot 1. 
 In this example, it is clear how much of the consideration under the original contract relates to Plot 1 and how much to Plot 2. More commonly, the consideration under the original contract would need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis as required under paragraph 4 of Schedule 4. 
 If the subject-matter of the original contract is a freehold interest, an assignment of rights (or sub-sale) involving the grant of a lease out of that freehold cannot be a pre-completion transaction, as the lease is not the whole or part of the subject-matter of the original contract (paragraph 3(1)(a) and 4(1)). The same rules apply if the subject-matter of the original contract is a head-lease and the assignment (or sub-sale) involves the grant of a sub-lease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 - Sub-sale of part 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. C must also make a land transaction return (with B as seller), with consideration of £400,000. 
  
The transactions are within Schedule 2 because: 
 
 the transactions are within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is a ‘free-standing transfer’ 
 
 The original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B. 
 The transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction. 
 The pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so paragraph 13 applies. 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £400,000 paid by C to B in the normal way. 
 In the absence of any special provision, B is regarded as entering into a land transaction with A for consideration of £1m. 
 The pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale if the relevant conditions are met. B can therefore claim relief (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR). Since the sub-sale relates to only part of the subject-matter of the original contract, B cannot claim full relief. Instead, the consideration for the transaction is reduced by the amount of the £1m consideration that relates to Plot 2. In this case that is £400,000 so the B’s consideration is reduced to £600,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 5 - Sub-sales and linked transactions 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract, and how the linked transaction rules apply where the parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for the freehold of some non-residential land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 B and C are connected 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. 
 Because B and C were connected, C’s acquisition is subject to the minimum consideration rules (paragraphs 15-17). In this example, the apportionment of £600,000 / £400,000 between Plot 1 and Plot 2 is fair and reasonable. Under the minimum consideration rules, the first minimum amount and second minimum amount are both £400,000 in this example. This is the same as the amount that the consideration would be under the normal rules. The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is therefore £400,000. 
 Even though C is purchasing from B, for the purposes of the legislation, the seller for C’s acquisition is A, as per paragraph 14(2) (see also 14(5)). This means that the two transactions (between A and B, and B and C) are linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of LTTA2017. Therefore, the tax for each return (using the bands and rates in force as at 01/04/2018) must be calculated as follows: 
 
 the total chargeable consideration for both transactions is £1,000,000 (A can claim partial relief of £400,000, reducing the consideration from B to A to £600,000. Add to this the £400,000 C must pay to B, gives a total of £1,000,000)  
 the total tax chargeable against £1,000,000 using the non-residential bands and rates is £38,500 
 B must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £600,000 = £23,100 
 C must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £400,000 = £15,400 
 Both returns must show A as the seller 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 6 - Series of assignments 
 
 
   
 This example covers a number of slightly different scenarios involving a series of assignments of rights. 
 In the first scenario, the final transferee pays an additional amount of consideration. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £150,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £150,000 totalling £1,050,000, that is the total consideration given by D. 
 Paragraph 8 applies in the following way. The acquisition by D is ‘the transferee’s land transaction’ (paragraph 8(1)(a)). The assignment from C to D is ‘the implemented assignment of rights’ (paragraph 5(3)). B is the buyer under a notional land transaction (paragraph 8(1)). C is the buyer under an additional land transaction (paragraph 8(3)). 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s transaction – the notional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(a). It is the £100,000 paid by B to A (amount ‘B’ in paragraph 8(8)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ in paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1m. B can claim relief. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s transaction – an additional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(b). It is the £100,000 paid by C to B (amount ‘C’ in paragraph 8(9) – in calculating amount C, ‘the preceding assignment of rights’ was the assignment from B to C (paragraph 8(10)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ - paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1 million. C can claim relief. 
 In the second scenario, D pays less. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £50,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £50,000 totalling £950,000, that is the total chargeable consideration given by D. 
 The position of B and C is the same as in the previous scenario. 
  
In the final scenario, there is a series of assignments of rights where D is connected with C. In this example, C gets a good deal from B in an entirely commercial transaction. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £50,000 and C assigns its rights to D for nil. C and D are connected. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus nil totalling £900,000. But the minimum consideration rule applies. Both the first and second minimum amounts are £950,000 (see below) so D is chargeable on £950,000. 
 The position of B and C is similar to the earlier examples. 
 The first minimum amount is given by paragraph 16(3). C is the transferor (‘T’) (‘Condition B’ in paragraph 16(3)) and C is also ‘the first T’. Paragraph 16(3) picks up only the £50,000 paid by C to B plus the £900,000 payable on completion, and not the full £1 million under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is given by paragraph 17. The relevant parties are C and D, not B (paragraph 14(4)). The net amount of consideration given by D is £900,000 and the net amount of consideration given by C is £50,000 (paragraph 17(2)). The second minimum amount is also £950,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 7 - Series of sub-sales 
 
 
   
 This is an example of a series of sub-sales. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement with C for £1m, with C paying a deposit of £100,000. 
 C enters into a sub-sale agreement with D for £1.1m, with D paying deposit of £200,000 to C. 
 The contracts are completed together. On completion, D pays C £900,000, C pays B £900,000, and B pays A £900,000. 
 
 B and C are chargeable on £1m according to the normal rules as they have completed (without prior substantial performance) their contracts. They can claim relief. D is chargeable on £1.1m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 8 - Exchanges – assignments 
 
 
   
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for Plot 1 with consideration of £1m which reflects the market value of Plot 1. B pays A a deposit of £500,000. 
 B assigns its interest under the contract to C in return for consideration of Plot 2 from C. Plot 2 is worth £400,000. This is acceptable to B because the site of Plot 2 is commercially beneficial to B. 
 On completion, C pays A £500,000 for Plot 1. 
 
 C has entered into one transaction as buyer (the acquisition of Plot 1 by C) in consideration of entering into another transaction as seller in another (the acquisition of Plot 2 by B). The exchange rules therefore apply. 
 B is chargeable on a notional land transaction for which relief can be claimed. The chargeable consideration is £1m. 
 B is chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 2 from C. The chargeable consideration is determined by paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. This is the market value of Plot 2 (£400,000). That amount cannot be apportioned in any way as it was not given for anything other than as consideration for Plot 2. So the chargeable consideration is £400,000. 
 C is chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 1. The chargeable consideration is given by paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. The market value of Plot 1 is £1m. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 4, read according to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2, would give chargeable consideration of £900,000 – the £500,000 given by C to A on completion plus the consideration given for the assignment, namely the £400,000 market value of Plot 2 (paragraph 8(7)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 9 - Exchanges – sub-sales 
 
 
   
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for Plot 1 with a consideration of £1m which reflects the market value of Plot 1. B pays A a deposit of £500,000. 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement for Plot 1 with C, for consideration of £500,000 cash plus Plot 2. Plot 2 has a market value of £400,000. This is acceptable to B because the site of Plot 2 is commercially beneficial to B. The agreements are completed at the same time and in connection with each other. 
 
 C has entered into one transaction as buyer (the acquisition of Plot 1 by C) in consideration of entering into another transaction as seller in another (the acquisition of Plot 2 by B). The exchange rules therefore apply. 
 B is chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 1 from A but can claim relief. 
 B is also chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 2 from C. The chargeable consideration is determined by paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. This is the market value of Plot 2 (£400,000). 
 C is chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 1. The chargeable consideration is given by paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. The market value of Plot 1 is £1m, the chargeable consideration is therefore £1m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 10 - Acquisition by a connected company 
 
 
   
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m which reflects the market value of the land. Completion is set for 2 years after the agreement is entered into. 
 After one year, the market value of the land has increased to £1.1m. B enters into a sub-sale agreement with C for consideration of £900,000. C is a company connected with B. Both agreements are completed at the same time and in connection with each other. 
 
 B is chargeable on its acquisition of the land and can claim relief. 
 C is chargeable on its acquisition of the land. In the first instance, the chargeable consideration given by paragraph 13 (as it applies to paragraph 1 of Schedule 4) is £900,000. 
 The deemed market value rule in section 53 does not apply because the seller for C’s acquisition is A (paragraph 10(4)). So the chargeable consideration is not increased to £1.1m. 
 However, B and C are connected, so the minimum consideration rule applies to increase the chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition from £900,000 given to £1m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 11 - Partnerships 
 
 
   
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m which reflects the market value of the land. 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement with C for consideration of £1m. C is a partnership in which B has a 90% partnership share. The 2 agreements complete at the same time and in connection with each other. 
 
 B is chargeable on its acquisition of the land and can claim relief. 
 C is chargeable on its acquisition of the land. The chargeable consideration given by paragraph 13 (as it applies to paragraph 1 of Schedule 4) is £1m. C does not get the benefit of the rules for special partnership transactions in Part 3 of Schedule 15 because the seller for C’s acquisition is A (i.e. not a partner in the partnership). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 12 - Novation 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a novation. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. 
 A, B and C enter into a deed of novation under which: C replaces B as the buyer of the land; and C pays B £100,000 in consideration for B relinquishing its rights under the first contract. Under the deed, A and B are released from any obligations to each other. Following the deed of novation, the original contract between A and B no longer exists. It has been replaced by a new contract between A and C. 
 C completes the new contract to acquire the land from A and pays A £1m. 
 
 The novation is a pre-completion transfer because it is a free-standing transfer. It is not an assignment of rights because C’s right to call for a transfer is not a right under the original contract, it is a right under the new contract. C is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the novation. 
 On completion, C is the buyer under a land transaction. The chargeable consideration under paragraph 13 is £1.1m. 
 B is not the buyer under a land transaction so is not required to file a land transaction return and has no need to claim relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 - Simple assignments of rights 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B assigns its rights under the contract to C for a payment of £100,000. 
 C completes the acquisition and pays A £1m. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £1.1m. 
 The transactions fall within Schedule 2 in the following way: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction in paragraphs 2 and 3; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’ that falls within paragraph 6; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction (paragraph 5) 
 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
 C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is established in line with the rules in Schedule 4. The result is that both the £1m given to A and the £100,000 given to B are included – total £1.1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A; the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 The position of the transferor, B, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction; 
 The chargeable consideration for the notional land transaction is the total of amount A and amount B. Amount A is £1m as that is the consideration given by C to A under the original contract. Amount B is nil as there was no other consideration given under the original contract, so the chargeable consideration for taxpayer B is £1m; 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B assigns its rights under the contract to C for a payment of £100,000. 
 C completes the acquisition and pays A £1m. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £1.1m. 
 The transactions fall within Schedule 2 in the following way: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction in paragraphs 2 and 3; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’ that falls within paragraph 6; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction (paragraph 5) 
 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
 C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is established in line with the rules in Schedule 4. The result is that both the £1m given to A and the £100,000 given to B are included – total £1.1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A; the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 The position of the transferor, B, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction; 
 The chargeable consideration for the notional land transaction is the total of amount A and amount B. Amount A is £1m as that is the consideration given by C to A under the original contract. Amount B is nil as there was no other consideration given under the original contract, so the chargeable consideration for taxpayer B is £1m; 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B assigns its rights under the contract to C for a payment of £100,000. 
 C completes the acquisition and pays A £1m. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £1.1m. 
 The transactions fall within Schedule 2 in the following way: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction in paragraphs 2 and 3; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’ that falls within paragraph 6; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B;

 The seller for C’s acquisition is A; the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 The position of the transferor, B, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction; 
 The chargeable consideration for the notional land transaction is the total of amount A and amount B. Amount A is £1m as that is the consideration given by C to A under the original contract. Amount B is nil as there was no other consideration given under the original contract, so the chargeable consideration for taxpayer B is £1m; 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 
 Example 2 - Sub-sale and minimum consideration rule 
 
 
   
 This is an example of a sub-sale. It also illustrates how the minimum consideration rule works where parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land for consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B enters into a sale and purchase agreement for the same land with C for consideration of £900,000 payable on completion. 
 At a single completion meeting the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £900,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 If B and C are unconnected and acting at arm’s length, then B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £900,000. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction that is a free-standing transfer; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so the rules concerning a free-standing transfer apply; 
 in the absence of any special provision, B is regarded as entering into a land transaction with A for consideration of £1m (the amount in the original contract); 
 the pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale and meets the relevant conditions set out for relief for qualifying sub-sales. So B can claim relief (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR) 
 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £900,000 paid by C to B in the normal way. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
  
If B and C were connected, C’s acquisition would be subject to the minimum consideration rule – paragraphs 15-17 – with the intended outcome that the chargeable consideration should be increased from £900,000 to £1m. 
 The consideration for C’s acquisition is taken to be the greatest of three amounts: either the £900,000 already determined above (i.e. what C paid to A) or the first minimum amount or the second minimum amount. 
 The first minimum amount is defined in paragraph 16(2) and (3). In this case it is the £1m that was due under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is set out in paragraph 17 and is the total of the net amounts of consideration (as determined in sub-paragraph 17(2)) given by the relevant parties (as per sub-paragraph 17(3)) and subject to sub-paragraph 17(4)). In this case, B and C are the relevant parties. The net amount of consideration given by C is £900,000. The net amount of consideration given by B is £100,000 (that is, the £1m given to A less the £900,000 received from C). So the total of the net amounts of consideration is £1m. 
 The result is that the consideration for C’s acquisition is £1m – the greatest amount out of £900,000, £1m and £1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 This means that the transactions described in this example will be linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of the act. For an example of how this works in practice, see example 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This is an example of a sub-sale. It also illustrates how the minimum consideration rule works where parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land for consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B enters into a sale and purchase agreement for the same land with C for consideration of £900,000 payable on completion. 
 At a single completion meeting the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £900,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 If B and C are unconnected and acting at arm’s length, then B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £900,000. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction that is a free-standing transfer; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so the rules concerning a free-standing transfer apply; 
 in the absence of any special provision, B is regarded as entering into a land transaction with A for consideration of £1m (the amount in the original contract); 
 the pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale and meets the relevant conditions set out for relief for qualifying sub-sales. So B can claim relief (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR)

 The second minimum amount is set out in paragraph 17 and is the total of the net amounts of consideration (as determined in sub-paragraph 17(2)) given by the relevant parties (as per sub-paragraph 17(3)) and subject to sub-paragraph 17(4)). In this case, B and C are the relevant parties. The net amount of consideration given by C is £900,000. The net amount of consideration given by B is £100,000 (that is, the £1m given to A less the £900,000 received from C). So the total of the net amounts of consideration is £1m. 
 The result is that the consideration for C’s acquisition is £1m – the greatest amount out of £900,000, £1m and £1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 This means that the transactions described in this example will be linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of the act. For an example of how this works in practice, see example 5. 
 
 
 
 
 This is an example of a sub-sale. It also illustrates how the minimum consideration rule works where parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land for consideration of £1m payable on completion. 
 B enters into a sale and purchase agreement for the same land with C for consideration of £900,000 payable on completion. 
 At a single completion meeting the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £900,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 If B and C are unconnected and acting at arm’s length, then B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £1m but can include a claim for full relief. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £900,000.

 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction;

 The second minimum amount is set out in paragraph 17 and is the total of the net amounts of consideration (as determined in sub-paragraph 17(2)) given by the relevant parties (as per sub-paragraph 17(3)) and subject to sub-paragraph 17(4)). In this case, B and C are the relevant parties. The net amount of consideration given by C is £900,000. The net amount of consideration given by B is £100,000 (that is, the £1m given to A less the £900,000 received from C). So the total of the net amounts of consideration is £1m. 
 The result is that the consideration for C’s acquisition is £1m – the greatest amount out of £900,000, £1m and £1m. 
 The seller for C’s acquisition is A and the land transaction return should be completed accordingly. 
 This means that the transactions described in this example will be linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of the act. For an example of how this works in practice, see example 5. 
 
 Example 3 - Assignment of part 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B assigns its rights to Plot 2 under the contract to C. 
 C completes the acquisition of Plot 2 and pays A £400,000. 
 B completes the acquisition of Plot 1 and pays A £600,000. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £400,000 in respect of Plot 2 but can include a claim for full relief of the tax arising on that amount of consideration. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £400,000. B must also make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £600,000 in respect of Plot 1. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 as there is an assignment of rights relating to only a part of the original contract, paragraph 10 ensures that the rules are to be operated as though there was a separate original contract for Plot 2 
 
 The transferee, C, completes their return and pays tax on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2. 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The £600,000 given by B on completion of the acquisition of Plot 1 is regarded as given under a different contract. C’s return will show themselves as buyer and A as seller with just the £400,000 given by C on completion as the chargeable consideration. 
  
The position of the transferor, B, on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2 and relief being available, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction. 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s acquisition is dealt with in paragraph 8(6)(a). That consideration is £400,000 as that is the consideration given by C to A in respect of the subject matter of the original contract. 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 This leaves the acquisition of Plot 1 by B. The facts are that B has entered into a land transaction with chargeable consideration of the £600,000 that B gives to acquire Plot 1. 
 In this example, it is clear how much of the consideration under the original contract relates to Plot 1 and how much to Plot 2. More commonly, the consideration under the original contract would need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis as required under paragraph 4 of Schedule 4. 
 If the subject-matter of the original contract is a freehold interest, an assignment of rights (or sub-sale) involving the grant of a lease out of that freehold cannot be a pre-completion transaction, as the lease is not the whole or part of the subject-matter of the original contract (paragraph 3(1)(a) and 4(1)). The same rules apply if the subject-matter of the original contract is a head-lease and the assignment (or sub-sale) involves the grant of a sub-lease. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B assigns its rights to Plot 2 under the contract to C. 
 C completes the acquisition of Plot 2 and pays A £400,000. 
 B completes the acquisition of Plot 1 and pays A £600,000. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £400,000 in respect of Plot 2 but can include a claim for full relief of the tax arising on that amount of consideration. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £400,000. B must also make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £600,000 in respect of Plot 1. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction; 
 as there is an assignment of rights relating to only a part of the original contract, paragraph 10 ensures that the rules are to be operated as though there was a separate original contract for Plot 2 
 
 The transferee, C, completes their return and pays tax on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2. 
 The position of the transferee, C, is covered mainly by paragraph 11. 
C is the buyer under a land transaction and this is not prevented by the words ‘between the same parties’. 
 The £600,000 given by B on completion of the acquisition of Plot 1 is regarded as given under a different contract. C’s return will show themselves as buyer and A as seller with just the £400,000 given by C on completion as the chargeable consideration. 
  
The position of the transferor, B, on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2 and relief being available, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction. 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s acquisition is dealt with in paragraph 8(6)(a). That consideration is £400,000 as that is the consideration given by C to A in respect of the subject matter of the original contract. 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 This leaves the acquisition of Plot 1 by B. The facts are that B has entered into a land transaction with chargeable consideration of the £600,000 that B gives to acquire Plot 1. 
 In this example, it is clear how much of the consideration under the original contract relates to Plot 1 and how much to Plot 2. More commonly, the consideration under the original contract would need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis as required under paragraph 4 of Schedule 4. 
 If the subject-matter of the original contract is a freehold interest, an assignment of rights (or sub-sale) involving the grant of a lease out of that freehold cannot be a pre-completion transaction, as the lease is not the whole or part of the subject-matter of the original contract (paragraph 3(1)(a) and 4(1)). The same rules apply if the subject-matter of the original contract is a head-lease and the assignment (or sub-sale) involves the grant of a sub-lease. 
 
 
 
 
 This is an example of how the rules apply to an assignment of rights relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B assigns its rights to Plot 2 under the contract to C. 
 C completes the acquisition of Plot 2 and pays A £400,000. 
 B completes the acquisition of Plot 1 and pays A £600,000. 
 
 The outcome is that B must make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £400,000 in respect of Plot 2 but can include a claim for full relief of the tax arising on that amount of consideration. C must make a land transaction return with consideration of £400,000. B must also make a land transaction return for a transaction with consideration of £600,000 in respect of Plot 1. 
 This is because: 
 
 the transactions fall within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is an ‘assignment of rights’; 
 the original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B; 
 the transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction;

 The £600,000 given by B on completion of the acquisition of Plot 1 is regarded as given under a different contract. C’s return will show themselves as buyer and A as seller with just the £400,000 given by C on completion as the chargeable consideration. 
  
The position of the transferor, B, on the basis that there was a ‘separate contract’ for Plot 2 and relief being available, is that: 
 
 B is deemed to be the buyer under a notional land transaction with the same effective date as C’s land transaction. 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s acquisition is dealt with in paragraph 8(6)(a). That consideration is £400,000 as that is the consideration given by C to A in respect of the subject matter of the original contract. 
 The transactions permit B to claim full relief from tax (subject to the complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief targeted anti-avoidance rule). 
 
 This leaves the acquisition of Plot 1 by B. The facts are that B has entered into a land transaction with chargeable consideration of the £600,000 that B gives to acquire Plot 1. 
 In this example, it is clear how much of the consideration under the original contract relates to Plot 1 and how much to Plot 2. More commonly, the consideration under the original contract would need to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis as required under paragraph 4 of Schedule 4. 
 If the subject-matter of the original contract is a freehold interest, an assignment of rights (or sub-sale) involving the grant of a lease out of that freehold cannot be a pre-completion transaction, as the lease is not the whole or part of the subject-matter of the original contract (paragraph 3(1)(a) and 4(1)). The same rules apply if the subject-matter of the original contract is a head-lease and the assignment (or sub-sale) involves the grant of a sub-lease. 
 
 Example 4 - Sub-sale of part 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. C must also make a land transaction return (with B as seller), with consideration of £400,000. 
  
The transactions are within Schedule 2 because: 
 
 the transactions are within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is a ‘free-standing transfer’ 
 
 The original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B. 
 The transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction. 
 The pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so paragraph 13 applies. 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £400,000 paid by C to B in the normal way. 
 In the absence of any special provision, B is regarded as entering into a land transaction with A for consideration of £1m. 
 The pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale if the relevant conditions are met. B can therefore claim relief (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR). Since the sub-sale relates to only part of the subject-matter of the original contract, B cannot claim full relief. Instead, the consideration for the transaction is reduced by the amount of the £1m consideration that relates to Plot 2. In this case that is £400,000 so the B’s consideration is reduced to £600,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. C must also make a land transaction return (with B as seller), with consideration of £400,000. 
  
The transactions are within Schedule 2 because: 
 
 the transactions are within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is a ‘free-standing transfer’ 
 
 The original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B. 
 The transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction. 
 The pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so paragraph 13 applies. 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £400,000 paid by C to B in the normal way.

 The pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale if the relevant conditions are met. B can therefore claim relief (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR). Since the sub-sale relates to only part of the subject-matter of the original contract, B cannot claim full relief. Instead, the consideration for the transaction is reduced by the amount of the £1m consideration that relates to Plot 2. In this case that is £400,000 so the B’s consideration is reduced to £600,000. 
 
 
 
 
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. C must also make a land transaction return (with B as seller), with consideration of £400,000. 
  
The transactions are within Schedule 2 because: 
 
 the transactions are within the definition of a pre-completion transaction; 
 the pre-completion transaction is a ‘free-standing transfer’ 
 
 The original contract is the contract between A and B, the original buyer is B, the transferee is C and the transferor is B. 
 The transferee is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the pre-completion transaction. 
 The pre-completion transaction is not an assignment of rights so paragraph 13 applies. 
 C’s acquisition from B is one which has completed without prior substantial performance. The consideration is taken to include the consideration given for the free-standing transfer, although that is nil in this case. So the consideration is just the £400,000 paid by C to B in the normal way.

 The pre-completion transaction is a qualifying sub-sale if the relevant conditions are met. B can therefore claim relief (subject to complying with the specific relief rule and not meeting the conditions that would trigger the relief TAAR). Since the sub-sale relates to only part of the subject-matter of the original contract, B cannot claim full relief. Instead, the consideration for the transaction is reduced by the amount of the £1m consideration that relates to Plot 2. In this case that is £400,000 so the B’s consideration is reduced to £600,000. 
 
 Example 5 - Sub-sales and linked transactions 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract, and how the linked transaction rules apply where the parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for the freehold of some non-residential land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 B and C are connected 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. 
 Because B and C were connected, C’s acquisition is subject to the minimum consideration rules (paragraphs 15-17). In this example, the apportionment of £600,000 / £400,000 between Plot 1 and Plot 2 is fair and reasonable. Under the minimum consideration rules, the first minimum amount and second minimum amount are both £400,000 in this example. This is the same as the amount that the consideration would be under the normal rules. The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is therefore £400,000. 
 Even though C is purchasing from B, for the purposes of the legislation, the seller for C’s acquisition is A, as per paragraph 14(2) (see also 14(5)). This means that the two transactions (between A and B, and B and C) are linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of LTTA2017. Therefore, the tax for each return (using the bands and rates in force as at 01/04/2018) must be calculated as follows: 
 
 the total chargeable consideration for both transactions is £1,000,000 (A can claim partial relief of £400,000, reducing the consideration from B to A to £600,000. Add to this the £400,000 C must pay to B, gives a total of £1,000,000)  
 the total tax chargeable against £1,000,000 using the non-residential bands and rates is £38,500 
 B must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £600,000 = £23,100 
 C must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £400,000 = £15,400 
 Both returns must show A as the seller 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract, and how the linked transaction rules apply where the parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for the freehold of some non-residential land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 B and C are connected 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. 
 Because B and C were connected, C’s acquisition is subject to the minimum consideration rules (paragraphs 15-17). In this example, the apportionment of £600,000 / £400,000 between Plot 1 and Plot 2 is fair and reasonable. Under the minimum consideration rules, the first minimum amount and second minimum amount are both £400,000 in this example. This is the same as the amount that the consideration would be under the normal rules. The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is therefore £400,000. 
 Even though C is purchasing from B, for the purposes of the legislation, the seller for C’s acquisition is A, as per paragraph 14(2) (see also 14(5)). This means that the two transactions (between A and B, and B and C) are linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of LTTA2017. Therefore, the tax for each return (using the bands and rates in force as at 01/04/2018) must be calculated as follows: 
 
 the total chargeable consideration for both transactions is £1,000,000 (A can claim partial relief of £400,000, reducing the consideration from B to A to £600,000. Add to this the £400,000 C must pay to B, gives a total of £1,000,000)  
 the total tax chargeable against £1,000,000 using the non-residential bands and rates is £38,500 
 B must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £600,000 = £23,100 
 C must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £400,000 = £15,400 
 Both returns must show A as the seller 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a sub-sale relating to only part of the land under the original contract, and how the linked transaction rules apply where the parties are connected. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for the freehold of some non-residential land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. The land consists of Plot 1 (value £600,000) and Plot 2 (value £400,000). 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement to sell Plot 2 to C for £400,000. 
 B and C are connected 
 At a single completion meeting, the sales from A to B and from B to C are completed; consideration of £400,000 is paid by C to B and consideration of £1m is paid by B to A. 
 
 B must make a land transaction return for the land transaction with consideration, on first principles, of £1m but can include a claim for partial relief reducing the consideration to £600,000. 
 Because B and C were connected, C’s acquisition is subject to the minimum consideration rules (paragraphs 15-17). In this example, the apportionment of £600,000 / £400,000 between Plot 1 and Plot 2 is fair and reasonable. Under the minimum consideration rules, the first minimum amount and second minimum amount are both £400,000 in this example. This is the same as the amount that the consideration would be under the normal rules. The chargeable consideration for C’s acquisition is therefore £400,000. 
 Even though C is purchasing from B, for the purposes of the legislation, the seller for C’s acquisition is A, as per paragraph 14(2) (see also 14(5)). This means that the two transactions (between A and B, and B and C) are linked for the purposes of Section 8(1) of LTTA2017. Therefore, the tax for each return (using the bands and rates in force as at 01/04/2018) must be calculated as follows: 
 
 the total chargeable consideration for both transactions is £1,000,000 (A can claim partial relief of £400,000, reducing the consideration from B to A to £600,000. Add to this the £400,000 C must pay to B, gives a total of £1,000,000)  
 the total tax chargeable against £1,000,000 using the non-residential bands and rates is £38,500 
 B must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £600,000 = £23,100 
 C must file a return showing tax of £38,500 / £1,000,000 X £400,000 = £15,400 
 Both returns must show A as the seller 
 
 
 Example 6 - Series of assignments 
 
 
   
 This example covers a number of slightly different scenarios involving a series of assignments of rights. 
 In the first scenario, the final transferee pays an additional amount of consideration. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £150,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £150,000 totalling £1,050,000, that is the total consideration given by D. 
 Paragraph 8 applies in the following way. The acquisition by D is ‘the transferee’s land transaction’ (paragraph 8(1)(a)). The assignment from C to D is ‘the implemented assignment of rights’ (paragraph 5(3)). B is the buyer under a notional land transaction (paragraph 8(1)). C is the buyer under an additional land transaction (paragraph 8(3)). 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s transaction – the notional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(a). It is the £100,000 paid by B to A (amount ‘B’ in paragraph 8(8)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ in paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1m. B can claim relief. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s transaction – an additional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(b). It is the £100,000 paid by C to B (amount ‘C’ in paragraph 8(9) – in calculating amount C, ‘the preceding assignment of rights’ was the assignment from B to C (paragraph 8(10)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ - paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1 million. C can claim relief. 
 In the second scenario, D pays less. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £50,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £50,000 totalling £950,000, that is the total chargeable consideration given by D. 
 The position of B and C is the same as in the previous scenario. 
  
In the final scenario, there is a series of assignments of rights where D is connected with C. In this example, C gets a good deal from B in an entirely commercial transaction. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £50,000 and C assigns its rights to D for nil. C and D are connected. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus nil totalling £900,000. But the minimum consideration rule applies. Both the first and second minimum amounts are £950,000 (see below) so D is chargeable on £950,000. 
 The position of B and C is similar to the earlier examples. 
 The first minimum amount is given by paragraph 16(3). C is the transferor (‘T’) (‘Condition B’ in paragraph 16(3)) and C is also ‘the first T’. Paragraph 16(3) picks up only the £50,000 paid by C to B plus the £900,000 payable on completion, and not the full £1 million under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is given by paragraph 17. The relevant parties are C and D, not B (paragraph 14(4)). The net amount of consideration given by D is £900,000 and the net amount of consideration given by C is £50,000 (paragraph 17(2)). The second minimum amount is also £950,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 This example covers a number of slightly different scenarios involving a series of assignments of rights. 
 In the first scenario, the final transferee pays an additional amount of consideration. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £150,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £150,000 totalling £1,050,000, that is the total consideration given by D. 
 Paragraph 8 applies in the following way. The acquisition by D is ‘the transferee’s land transaction’ (paragraph 8(1)(a)). The assignment from C to D is ‘the implemented assignment of rights’ (paragraph 5(3)). B is the buyer under a notional land transaction (paragraph 8(1)). C is the buyer under an additional land transaction (paragraph 8(3)). 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s transaction – the notional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(a). It is the £100,000 paid by B to A (amount ‘B’ in paragraph 8(8)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ in paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1m. B can claim relief. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s transaction – an additional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(b). It is the £100,000 paid by C to B (amount ‘C’ in paragraph 8(9) – in calculating amount C, ‘the preceding assignment of rights’ was the assignment from B to C (paragraph 8(10)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ - paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1 million. C can claim relief. 
 In the second scenario, D pays less. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £50,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £50,000 totalling £950,000, that is the total chargeable consideration given by D. 
 The position of B and C is the same as in the previous scenario. 
  
In the final scenario, there is a series of assignments of rights where D is connected with C. In this example, C gets a good deal from B in an entirely commercial transaction. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £50,000 and C assigns its rights to D for nil. C and D are connected. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus nil totalling £900,000. But the minimum consideration rule applies. Both the first and second minimum amounts are £950,000 (see below) so D is chargeable on £950,000. 
 The position of B and C is similar to the earlier examples. 
 The first minimum amount is given by paragraph 16(3). C is the transferor (‘T’) (‘Condition B’ in paragraph 16(3)) and C is also ‘the first T’. Paragraph 16(3) picks up only the £50,000 paid by C to B plus the £900,000 payable on completion, and not the full £1 million under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is given by paragraph 17. The relevant parties are C and D, not B (paragraph 14(4)). The net amount of consideration given by D is £900,000 and the net amount of consideration given by C is £50,000 (paragraph 17(2)). The second minimum amount is also £950,000. 
 
 
 
 
 This example covers a number of slightly different scenarios involving a series of assignments of rights. 
 In the first scenario, the final transferee pays an additional amount of consideration. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £150,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £150,000 totalling £1,050,000, that is the total consideration given by D. 
 Paragraph 8 applies in the following way. The acquisition by D is ‘the transferee’s land transaction’ (paragraph 8(1)(a)). The assignment from C to D is ‘the implemented assignment of rights’ (paragraph 5(3)). B is the buyer under a notional land transaction (paragraph 8(1)). C is the buyer under an additional land transaction (paragraph 8(3)). 
 The chargeable consideration for B’s transaction – the notional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(a). It is the £100,000 paid by B to A (amount ‘B’ in paragraph 8(8)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ in paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1m. B can claim relief. 
 The chargeable consideration for C’s transaction – an additional land transaction – is given by paragraph 8(6)(b). It is the £100,000 paid by C to B (amount ‘C’ in paragraph 8(9) – in calculating amount C, ‘the preceding assignment of rights’ was the assignment from B to C (paragraph 8(10)) plus the £900,000 paid by D to A on completion (amount ‘A’ - paragraph 8(7)(b)) totalling £1 million. C can claim relief. 
 In the second scenario, D pays less. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £100,000 and C assigns its rights to D for £50,000. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus £50,000 totalling £950,000, that is the total chargeable consideration given by D. 
 The position of B and C is the same as in the previous scenario. 
  
In the final scenario, there is a series of assignments of rights where D is connected with C. In this example, C gets a good deal from B in an entirely commercial transaction. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B assigns its rights to C for £50,000 and C assigns its rights to D for nil. C and D are connected. 
 D pays A £900,000 on completion. 
 
 D is chargeable as the transferee. The chargeable consideration is £900,000 plus nil totalling £900,000. But the minimum consideration rule applies. Both the first and second minimum amounts are £950,000 (see below) so D is chargeable on £950,000. 
 The position of B and C is similar to the earlier examples. 
 The first minimum amount is given by paragraph 16(3). C is the transferor (‘T’) (‘Condition B’ in paragraph 16(3)) and C is also ‘the first T’. Paragraph 16(3) picks up only the £50,000 paid by C to B plus the £900,000 payable on completion, and not the full £1 million under the contract between A and B. 
 The second minimum amount is given by paragraph 17. The relevant parties are C and D, not B (paragraph 14(4)). The net amount of consideration given by D is £900,000 and the net amount of consideration given by C is £50,000 (paragraph 17(2)). The second minimum amount is also £950,000. 
 
 Example 7 - Series of sub-sales 
 
 
   
 This is an example of a series of sub-sales. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with consideration of £1 million. B pays A a deposit of £100,000. 
 B enters into a sub-sale agreement with C for £1m, with C paying a deposit of £100,000. 
 C enters into a sub-sale agreement with D for £1.1m, with D paying deposit of £200,000 to C. 
 The contracts are completed together. On completion, D pays C £900,000, C pays B £900,000, and B pays A £900,000. 
 
 B and C are chargeable on £1m according to the normal rules as they have completed (without prior substantial performance) their contracts. They can claim relief. D is chargeable on £1.1m.

 C is chargeable on the acquisition of Plot 1. The chargeable consideration is given by paragraph 5 of Schedule 4. The market value of Plot 1 is £1m. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 4, read according to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2, would give chargeable consideration of £900,000 – the £500,000 given by C to A on completion plus the consideration given for the assignment, namely the £400,000 market value of Plot 2 (paragraph 8(7)).

 Example 12 - Novation 
 
 
   
 This is an example of how the rules apply to a novation. 
 
 A enters into a sale and purchase agreement with B for some land with a consideration of £1 million payable on completion. 
 A, B and C enter into a deed of novation under which: C replaces B as the buyer of the land; and C pays B £100,000 in consideration for B relinquishing its rights under the first contract. Under the deed, A and B are released from any obligations to each other. Following the deed of novation, the original contract between A and B no longer exists. It has been replaced by a new contract between A and C. 
 C completes the new contract to acquire the land from A and pays A £1m. 
 
 The novation is a pre-completion transfer because it is a free-standing transfer. It is not an assignment of rights because C’s right to call for a transfer is not a right under the original contract, it is a right under the new contract. C is not regarded as entering into a land transaction by reason of the novation. 
 On completion, C is the buyer under a land transaction. The chargeable consideration under paragraph 13 is £1.1m. 
 B is not the buyer under a land transaction so is not required to file a land transaction return and has no need to claim relief.

 ",https://www.gov.wales/particular-transactions-technical-guidance
311,311,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2240 Options and rights of pre-emption," (section 15) 
 The acquisition of an option binding the grantor to enter into a land transaction or a right of pre-emption preventing the grantor from entering into a land transaction (or restricting their right) is also a land transaction. 
 When an option or right of pre-emption is granted, that land transaction is distinct from (but almost certainly linked to) the land transaction which is effected on the exercise of that option or right of pre-emption. The effective date of the transaction is the date of the grant of the option or right of pre-emption. 
 An option or right of pre-emption is not a major interest, although it is a chargeable interest. 
 An option to buy land is a right granted by the land owner to a prospective buyer to acquire the land. The option will often include the payment of a fee and set a time limit during which time that option will run. It is a right over land as the person granted the right can demand that the land be sold (to them). 
 A right of pre-emption is also known as a right of first refusal. The land owner must offer the property for sale to the holder of the right of pre-emption before offering it for sale to any other person. 
 Where an option has been granted, with consideration given for the grant of that option, and the option is exercised, the land transaction on the grant of the option and the land transaction on exercise of the option will be linked transactions. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/particular-transactions-technical-guidance
312,312,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Particular transactions,LTTA/2250 Exchanges," (section 16 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4) 
 An exchange (that is an exchange of interests in land) occurs when a land transaction is entered into by a person (alone or jointly) as buyer wholly or partly, in consideration of another land transaction that they (alone or jointly) enter as seller and the respective land transactions are in whole or part given as consideration for the other land. The 2 transactions are treated as separate and distinct from each other and are not linked transactions. 
 The rules for establishing the chargeable consideration given are available at LTTA/2260. 
 The rules in relation to a partition of land are available at LTTA/2360. 
 There are also special rules in relation to arrangements involving public or education bodies.

314,314,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2260 Chargeable consideration," (Schedule 4 as introduced by section 18(1) of, the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017). The chargeable consideration, except as expressly provided for elsewhere is any money or money’s worth given for the subject matter of the transaction. This includes consideration given directly and indirectly by the buyer or persons connected to them. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
315,315,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2261 Fixtures and fittings," If an item is annexed to the property, it is subject to LTT, as it is considered a fixture or part of the land. These items include: fitted kitchen units, cupboards and sinks (excluding white goods) fitted bathroom sanitary ware Agas and wall-mounted ovens  central heating systems intruder alarm systems external plants, shrubs or trees This is not an exhaustive list. Alternatively, the following items would not normally be considered fixtures, and so would not normally be subject to LTT. carpets (fitted or not) curtains or blinds free-standing furniture kitchen white goods (unless fully integrated) gas and electric fires (if they can be disconnected from the power supply without damaging the property) light fittings plants or trees growing in pots This is not an exhaustive list. An apportionment must be made on a just and reasonable basis for those items which are not considered to be fixtures or fittings. The apportioned amount may differ from the price agreed between the buyer and seller. In a commercial situation, any plant or machinery that can be easily removed from the property would not be considered a fixture. Any heavy plant or machinery that is integral to the property would be considered a fixture. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
316,316,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2270 Money or money’s worth," Money is easily understood and represents the amount of cash provided as consideration for the transaction, be that by cheque payment, electronic transfer etc. It will include monies provided to the seller and also money provided by the buyer to other persons at the direction of the seller, where that is a condition of entering into the land transaction. For example, fees for which the seller may be liable but which are to be paid by the buyer as part of the consideration for the subject-matter of the land transaction, are chargeable consideration. Examples of such fees might include the seller’s estate agent, legal, tender, introductory fees or the commission paid to an auction house for the sale of the property. Where such fees are paid by the buyer they, together with any VAT charged on the fees, will be chargeable consideration. Where fees are paid not at the direction of the seller, or are not conditional upon the transaction occurring then they are not likely to be part of the chargeable consideration. For example, money paid for a finder’s fee is a liability of the buyer not the seller and its payment is therefore not at the direction of the seller. It is the buyer’s liability and the land transaction is highly unlikely to be dependent upon payment of that finder’s fee. Likewise, fees for entry to or registration at an auction that permit the buyer to participate in the auction are unlikely to be part of the chargeable consideration given for the land transaction. ‘Money’s worth’ represents anything given in consideration that is not money but has a value that can be expressed as money. It therefore includes anything that has monetary value that is capable of being realised. It will include, for example, gold, jewellery, art works, cars, stocks and shares, etc.

317,317,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2280 Conversion of amounts of foreign currency," (Schedule 4 paragraph 10) If the consideration is expressed in another currency, including non-national currencies such as the electronic currency Bitcoin, the amount of consideration is to be ascertained by reference to the closing exchange rate on the effective date of the transaction. If it is necessary to convert the amount first into another currency (say US dollars) and then into sterling then these 2 conversions must be carried out (this may be the case with non-national currencies). However, if the parties have agreed a rate that differs from the London closing exchange rate, that rate should be used.

318,318,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2290 Valuation of non-monetary consideration," (Schedule 4 paragraph 7) The chargeable consideration, except as otherwise provided, and which is not money (whether sterling or another currency) or debt, is taken to be its market value at the effective date of the transaction. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
319,319,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2300 Market value," For the purposes of the LTTA Act, market value is determined in the same way as it is for the purposes of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. In particular, sections 272 to 274 of that Act. However, certain provisions require VAT to be included as part of the consideration. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
320,320,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2310 Value Added Tax (VAT)," (Schedule 4 paragraph 2) The chargeable consideration for a transaction includes any VAT chargeable in respect of the transaction. However, if an option to tax under Part 1 of Schedule 10 to the Value added Tax Act 1993 was made after the effective date of the transaction, the VAT arising on the consideration given is not chargeable consideration. The potential to elect for the option to tax does not constitute a contingent event. Such situations may arise where a landlord, after granting a lease, may elect for the option resulting in the tenant needing to pay VAT on the rent. Where there is a transfer of a going concern and that transfer meets all the relevant VAT conditions, VAT will not be payable. The chargeable consideration will therefore be the VAT exclusive amount. However, where those VAT conditions are not met and VAT is payable, that amount of VAT paid will be chargeable consideration. The chargeable consideration must reflect the rate of VAT in force at the effective date of the transaction. If there is a subsequent change in the rate of VAT it will not affect the computation of the chargeable consideration. Potential future changes to the VAT rate do not constitute a contingent event. Where a lease has an effective date of the transaction on or after the date that a VAT rate change occurred, the taxpayer must calculate the net present value (‘NPV’) of rent: using the ‘old’ VAT rate from the effective date of the transaction to the day preceding the first rent payment date, and the ‘new’ VAT rate on the rent payable on or after the first rent payment date Where the lease has an effective date of the transaction before the date the rate changed, potential future VAT rate changes are not treated as contingent consideration. However, in the event that the lease has variable or uncertain rents, if the taxpayer is required to make an additional return because a reconsideration date is reached, any VAT changes are to be taken into account. This is so that the annual rent amounts are established using the actual rates of VAT applying up to the reconsideration date. Any VAT rise (or decrease) will also be taken into account in establishing the highest rent paid in any 12 month period for the purposes of calculating the NPV for each year after year 5 of the lease. If a taxpayer incorrectly did not include VAT within the chargeable consideration and HMRC, in a VAT post-transaction ruling, determine that VAT was chargeable, the taxpayer must amend their LTT return to include the VAT element. If the return cannot be amended because the date for making such an amendment has expired, the taxpayer should write to WRA stating the additional consideration that is now chargeable. In the event that the taxpayer incorrectly included VAT in their calculation of chargeable consideration and as a result of a HMRC post-transaction ruling there is less chargeable consideration, the taxpayer may amend their return. If this is no longer possible, make a claim to WRA in accordance with section 63 TCMA 2016.

321,321,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2320 Postponed consideration and consideration paid by instalments," (Schedule 4 paragraph 3) The amount of the chargeable consideration for the land transaction is the full amount of the agreed consideration to be paid at any point in time (as opposed to that paid on completion or on substantial performance of the contract). There is no discount applied to payments due at future dates. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
322,322,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2330 Just and reasonable apportionment," (Schedule 4 paragraph 4) Chargeable consideration is only that consideration given for a land transaction. It is possible that a single deal can include; 2 or more land transactions, in part to a land transaction and in part to another matter, or, in part to matters making the consideration chargeable consideration and in part to other matters. In such cases, it is necessary for the taxpayer to apportion the consideration given for the single deal between that which relates to land transactions and that which relates to the other matters. The apportionment agreed between the buyer and seller, even where stated in a contract, may not represent a just and reasonable apportionment. It is the facts that establish the just and reasonable apportionment not the form of the contract. 2 common situations where just and reasonable apportionment will be required are where: fixtures and fittings are included in the price agreed for the sale of a property (for example curtains, furniture and white goods, potted plants in a residential sale. This does not include items affixed to the property (for example fitted furniture, sinks and baths, central heating systems etc.)), or the purchase of a business that includes the land and property, but also goodwill, plant and machinery, stock, etc Trees and fruit growing on them are part of the land and the consideration given for the land and the trees and crops is the chargeable consideration for the land transaction. Crops that have been harvested, felled trees and plants in pots are not part of the land. In addition, situations may arise where the land transaction relates to land in both Wales and elsewhere, either as a cross-border or a cross-title transaction, which will require a just and reasonable apportionment to establish the correct chargeable consideration for LTT. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
323,323,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2340 Goodwill," The WRA will adopt the same principles as  HMRC in relation to the valuation of goodwill(https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-duty-land-tax-manual/sdltm04005) . The WRA accepts that if a business is sold as a going concern, the sale may include some element of goodwill. The question to be answered is not whether goodwill exists, but what is the value of that goodwill. That question has to be decided on the facts of each individual case and will vary depending on the type of property and its use. In some cases the value of the goodwill may be nominal but in others it may be substantial. Goodwill is the difference between the value of a business as a going concern and the value of the separately identifiable assets included in the sale. The WRA will consider that the value of any goodwill in trade related properties should be arrived at by deducting the value of the separately identifiable assets included in the sale from the value of the business as a going concern. A trade related property is defined in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Guidance Note 2 (GN2) as “any type of real property designed for a specific type of business where the property value reflects the trading potential for that business”, for example, pubs, hotels, petrol stations, post offices etc. The value of a business as a going concern will usually be represented by the actual sale price achieved in the open market. However, if the sale was not at arms length it will be necessary to establish that arms length value of the business as a going concern. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance
324,324,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2350 Exchanges," (Schedule 4 paragraph 5) An exchange occurs when one or more land transactions are entered into by a buyer, jointly or solely, in consideration, wholly or partly, for one or more land transactions being entered into by them, jointly or solely, as seller. There are specific expressions used in the exchange rules: ‘relevant transaction’ which means any transaction related to the exchange ‘relevant acquisition’ means a relevant transaction entered into as buyer, and ‘relevant disposal’ means a relevant transaction entered into as seller Where the subject-matter is a major interest in land for a single relevant acquisition, the chargeable consideration is: the market value of the subject-matter of the acquisition at the effective date of the transaction. Market value excludes VAT if the acquisition was the grant of a lease at rent that rent, and any value added tax chargeable in respect of that acquisition at the effective date of the transaction Where the subject-matter includes major interests in land for a number of relevant acquisitions, the chargeable consideration is: the market value of the subject-matter of each acquisition at the effective date of the transaction. Market value excludes VAT if any of the acquisitions was the grant of a lease at rent that rent, and any value added tax chargeable in respect of those acquisitions at the effective date of the transaction Where the subject-matter of the transactions does not include a major interest in land: where there is a single relevant acquisition made in consideration for one or more relevant disposals, the chargeable consideration for the acquisition is any chargeable consideration given other than the relevant disposals – the interests exchanged are disregarded where there are 2 or more relevant acquisitions made in consideration of one or more relevant disposals, the chargeable consideration for each acquisition is the ‘appropriate proportion’ of the chargeable consideration given other than for the relevant disposal or disposals the ‘appropriate proportion’ is calculated using the formula MV ÷TMV MV is the market value of the subject-matter of the acquisition for which the chargeable consideration is being determined. Market value excludes VAT TMV is the market value of the subject-matter of all relevant acquisitions. When establishing the market value, no account is to be taken of a reduction in what would otherwise be the market value if that reduction is the result of anything done where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is to avoid tax, whether by the buyer or another person. The rule prohibits the inclusion of covenants, options to acquire, etc. that can impact the market value on the effective date but will not, or are unlikely to, impact on the enjoyment of the property. The amount of consideration given (perhaps including a cash equity payment) is likely to be indicative of the market value. For example, a time limited covenant to the effective date may impact on the value of the land on that date. The fact that it is no longer in effect on the following day means that it should not be taken into account in establishing the market value on the effective date of the transaction.

The agreement between the two parties is that the land owned before the transaction by G Ltd is worth, to H Ltd, £700,000 (G Ltd is perhaps in financial difficulties and willing to sell quickly at under market value). Both plots of land are subject to VAT. G Ltd is the buyer of land with a market value of £500,000 plus VAT (assumed rate 20%) of £100,000 actually payable. It must return that land transaction and pay LTT based on the consideration of £600,000. H Ltd is the buyer of land where the consideration given is £700,000 plus VAT of £140,000. It must make a land transaction return with chargeable consideration of £1,140,000, that is the market value of the land (£1 million) plus VAT actually payable on the transaction (£140,000).

325,325,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2360 Partitions – disregard of existing interest," (Schedule 4 paragraph 6) Where 2 or more people are jointly entitled to land and there is a partition or division of the land, this is not treated as an exchange. The giving up of a share in one part of the land is not treated as chargeable consideration for the acquisition of a share in another part. Taxpayers are ‘jointly entitled’ if they are beneficially entitled as joint tenants or tenants in common. This only applies where the land is in Wales; any share of land in England given in exchange for land in Wales (as part of a partition) is not covered by these rules. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Ms A and Mr A (her brother) own a farm jointly in equal shares. They decide to partition the farm and it is agreed that Ms A will take 50% of the land and Mr A will take the other 50% of the land. The total market value of the land is £2m. If each half of the land is of equal value (in this scenario, where each 50% of the land held by Ms A and Mr A is worth £1m) then no LTT is chargeable. However, if the land taken by Ms A includes the farmhouse and farm buildings the agreement may result in Ms A making a compensatory payment to her brother. If the land retained by Ms A has a value of £300,000 greater than the land that is to be retained by Mr A, then Ms A’s share is worth £1,150,000 and her brother’s share is worth £850,000. Ms A agrees to compensate Mr A by paying £150,000 to equalise the partition. This payment of £150,000 is chargeable consideration for the partition. An LTT return will be required showing that amount as chargeable consideration.

 Ms B and Ms C own Property D and Property E together as tenants in common. Both hold a 50% interest in each property. They decide to divide their interests in the properties so that Ms B obtains 100% interest in Property D, worth £500,000 and Ms C obtains 100% interest in Property E, worth £300,000. Ms B agrees to pay Ms C £100,000 as an equalisation payment. The payment of £100,000 is chargeable consideration for the division.

326,326,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2370 Purchase of land with associated works to be carried out," This guidance applies where the seller agrees to sell land to the buyer and the seller also agrees to carry out work, commonly works of construction, improvement or repair, on the land sold. The chargeable consideration, except as expressly provided for elsewhere is any money or money’s worth given for the subject matter of the transaction. The WRA will apply the decision in Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v IRC [1992] STC 863 to the identification of the subject-matter of the transaction. The decision is therefore relevant for LTT. The identification of the subject-matter of the transaction must relate to the commercial substance of the transaction. The subject-matter of the land transaction will normally be the land in its condition at the date of transfer. A common example is where land is transferred by the seller to the buyer and, at that date, the work on the land either has not started or is incomplete. Where the sale of land and the works contract are effectively one bargain, as they were in the Prudential case, there must be a just and reasonable apportionment of the total consideration given for all elements of the bargain, including the subject matter of the transaction, to arrive at the chargeable consideration for LTT purposes. However, there may be cases where the agreement for the sale of the land is so interlocked with the agreement for works that it cannot be independently completed. For example, this may be the case where the agreements provide that, if default occurs on one agreement, the other cannot be enforced. In such cases, the subject matter of the land transaction will be the land with the works to be completed. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mrs A buys a piece of land from Company B, a property development company. At the same time, Mrs A and Company B also enter into an agreement for Company B to build a house on the land. The agreement for the sale of land and the agreement for the house build are entered into simultaneously and are part of the same bargain. The total being paid by Mrs A is £400,000. There is no provision that, where default occurs on one agreement, the other cannot be enforced. The effective date of the transfer of the land is 30 June 2020. On that date, only 50% of the building works are complete. To find the chargeable consideration for LTT purposes, the £400,000 must be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis between the amount given for the land in its condition at the date of the transfer (including the 50% completed works) and the outstanding work under the house build agreement.

327,327,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2380 Carrying out of works," (Schedule 4 paragraph 11) Where the whole or part of the consideration for a land transaction includes a buyer carrying out works of construction, improvement or repair of a building or other works to enhance the value of land, these are not chargeable consideration if: they are carried out after the effective date of the transaction, and they are to be carried out on the land acquired (or to be acquired by the transaction) or any other land held by the buyer or a person connected with them, and it is not a condition of the transaction that the seller or a person connected to them carries out the works If these conditions are not met, the value of the works carried out on an open market basis will be chargeable consideration for the transaction. For LTT the open market value is to include any amount of VAT that would be payable on the amount of the works. In situations where the transaction is a notifiable transaction both at substantial performance and upon completion, if the works were carried out after the effective date for the substantial performance, it is taken as met for the completion of the transaction (even where the works were started (or completed) between the date of substantial performance and the date of completion of the contract). Special rules apply in relation to arrangements involving public or educational bodies. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd, a construction company, enters into a contract to acquire a plot of land from B Ltd. Under the terms of the contract, A Ltd is to pay £1m and is to build a new workshop for B Ltd on a plot of land owned by B Ltd in a nearby town. The cost of constructing the workshop (at open market value) is £750,000. The chargeable consideration for LTT is £1,750,000 as the works are carried out by the buyer on land owned by the seller (all the conditions are therefore not met). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 C Ltd, a construction company, enters into a contract to acquire a plot of land from a County Council for a purchase price of £5M. As a condition of the sale C Ltd must construct a leisure centre for the Council on part of the land after completion.  The value of the works (at open market value) is £1M. The chargeable consideration for LTT is still £5m because the work is carried out after the effective date of the transaction, on land acquired or owned by the buyer and the works do not need to be carried out by the by the seller. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 D Ltd enters into a contract with E to purchase a freehold plot of land, the consideration for the transaction is £1m. Prior to completion, D Ltd goes onto the land to be acquired (under a license to occupy) and begins construction works. When D Ltd goes onto the land, they have substantially performed the contract. The substantial performance is a notifiable land transaction with the effective date being the date of entry. D Ltd must pay the LTT due on the consideration of £1m at this point. On completion, an additional return need only be made when there are any changes to the transaction between substantial performance and completion that affect the tax due. The construction works will not be chargeable consideration as they were carried out after the effective date (date of substantial performance is the effective date in this instance) on land acquired by the purchaser under the transaction and are not carried out by the seller. In the event that a return was required on completion of the transaction, if the condition that the works are carried out after the effective date is met for the first land transaction (substantial performance), it is treated as met for the second return as well. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 F Ltd enters into a contract to sell a freehold plot of land to an unconnected person, G Ltd. The consideration for the transaction is £1m and as a condition of the contract F Ltd will complete construction works on behalf of G Ltd. Those works have an estimated market value of £750,000 which will be paid for by G Ltd. Prior to completion G Ltd pays over £950,000 and F Ltd begins the construction works. The payment by G Ltd does not constitute substantial performance of the contract, as the market value of the construction works will be regarded as chargeable consideration. Because it is a condition of the transaction that the seller carry out these works, the £950,000 is not more than 90% of the total consideration. A return should be sent to the WRA on completion (or substantial performance if this occurs earlier) paying the LTT due on the cash consideration of £1m plus the £750,000 market value of the construction works to be carried out by F Ltd; a total chargeable consideration of £1,750,000, which is the sum paid by G Ltd to F Ltd. This is because whilst some of the necessary conditions are met, it is a condition of the transaction that the works are carried out by the seller. Therefore the consideration given for the works is part of the chargeable consideration given for the land transaction.

 F Ltd enters into a contract to sell a freehold plot of land to an unconnected person, G Ltd. The consideration for the transaction is £1m and as a condition of the contract F Ltd will complete construction works on behalf of G Ltd. Those works have an estimated market value of £750,000 which will be paid for by G Ltd. Prior to completion G Ltd pays over £950,000 and F Ltd begins the construction works. The payment by G Ltd does not constitute substantial performance of the contract, as the market value of the construction works will be regarded as chargeable consideration. Because it is a condition of the transaction that the seller carry out these works, the £950,000 is not more than 90% of the total consideration. A return should be sent to the WRA on completion (or substantial performance if this occurs earlier) paying the LTT due on the cash consideration of £1m plus the £750,000 market value of the construction works to be carried out by F Ltd; a total chargeable consideration of £1,750,000, which is the sum paid by G Ltd to F Ltd. This is because whilst some of the necessary conditions are met, it is a condition of the transaction that the works are carried out by the seller. Therefore the consideration given for the works is part of the chargeable consideration given for the land transaction.

Special rules apply in relation to arrangements involving public or educational bodies.

329,329,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2400 Debt as consideration," (Schedule 4 paragraph 8) If consideration for a land transaction consists in whole or in part of the satisfaction or release of debt owed by the seller, or the assumption of debt, the amount of debt that is satisfied, released or assumed, is chargeable consideration. Where there is an assumption of debt by the buyer, that can also, in certain circumstances, amount to a release of that same debt for the seller. In such a case the assumption of the debt alone is taken be the chargeable consideration. The legislation also makes it clear that there is an assumption of debt by the buyer when the rights or liabilities of any party to the transaction are changed in relation to the debt. Thus a buyer assumes liability not only where they give a personal covenant but also where the seller is released from their personal covenant, or where the buyer agrees to indemnify the seller for any liability. Where there is a transfer of a property subject to a debt, and the buyer assumes liability for all or part of that debt and either before or after the transfer (or both), the property is in joint ownership, the debt assumed is the proportion of the debt owed by the owners of the property. For joint tenants, the proportion of debt owed is calculated by dividing the total amount of the debt by the number of joint tenants. For tenants in common, the debt is apportioned in relation to the proportions of their respective undivided shares in the property. For example, a property might be transferred from the sole ownership of the seller into the joint ownership of the seller and the buyer, for example on marriage or vice versa. In such a case the acquiring spouse, on becoming a joint tenant, will be treated, assuming no other consideration is given, as giving consideration of 50% of the outstanding debt on the effective date of the transaction (that is the debt divided by the 2 joint tenants). A transferee normally accepts joint and several liability for any existing debt. However, the rule concerning the proportion of the debt assumed means that only that proportion is treated as chargeable consideration. This rule ensures that, despite the debt being joint and several, they are only liable on the relevant proportion of the debt which is established by their part share of the property. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A and Mr B are in a long term relationship. The home they live in is owned entirely by Mr A. Mr A decides that he wishes to transfer, as a gift, half of the property to Mr B. The property will therefore be owned in equal shares subject to a subsisting mortgage. Mr B, despite his interest being gifted to him, has assumed joint and several liability for the debt (i.e. potentially the whole of the debt). He is, however, only treated as assuming debt equal to 50% of the amount owing on the effective date of the transaction. This is because he is treated as owing none before the transaction and 50% after it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 Miss C owns her home which is mortgaged, the current balance on the mortgage is £250,000. Miss C and Mr D get married and Miss C wants to gift 50% of her property to Mr D. In order to make the gift she pays off the current mortgage by taking out a new joint mortgage in their names, meaning Mr D is jointly and severally liable for the debt. In taking out the new mortgage Miss C and Mr D decide to borrow £300,000, which is greater than the original mortgage balance. Mr D is treated as assuming debt equal to 50% of the amount owing on the effective date of the transaction (i.e £150,000). This is because he is treated as owing none before the transaction and 50% after it.

Assuming Miss E is released from the debt, or Mr F agrees to indemnify Miss E, there is an assumption of debt by Mr F. Mr F is treated as assuming debt equal to 70% of the amount owning. This is because Mr F is treated as owing 30% of the debt before the transfer and 100% after the transfer.

339,339,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,"LTTA/2440 Contingent, uncertain or unascertained consideration"," (sections 19 and 20) Chargeable consideration that is contingent or uncertain can be deferred, if all of the relevant conditions are met. Contingent consideration Where a contingency affects the eventual amount of consideration, buyers must calculate the consideration on the basis that the contingent amount will be payable. If the contingency is that an amount will no longer be payable, buyers must assume that that amount does not cease to be payable. Contingent therefore means that an amount is to be paid only if a specified future event occurs, or, that the amount will cease to be paid if a specified future event occurs. Uncertain consideration For the purposes of this section of guidance, uncertain (when in relation to consideration) means that the amount, or value of consideration cannot be accurately calculated as it depends on uncertain future events. Where the consideration is uncertain, buyers must make a reasonable estimate of the final consideration as at the effective date of the transaction. In the case of uncertain consideration where the taxpayer believes that the likelihood of the uncertain future event arising is low, it may be reasonable for them to request a nil deferral. When making a deferral request, the buyer should be aware of the guidance on interest on deferred amounts available at  LTTA/6200(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5589) . Unascertained consideration Unascertained consideration is that which is ascertainable but has yet to be calculated. The tax on consideration which is only unascertained cannot be deferred. If the amount is understated or overstated in the return and additional tax is payable, or a repayment is due to the taxpayer, they must submit a further return or make a claim for repayment. The following table sets out when tax can be deferred in certain circumstance. Unascertained consideration Uncertain consideration Contingent consideration Deferrable No No Yes Yes (Example 1) Yes Yes No Yes (Example 2) Yes No No No (Example 3) Yes No Yes Yes No Yes No Yes 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd (buyer) exchanges contracts with B Ltd to buy a plot of land for £10 million with an additional £5 million payable in the event that A Ltd is successful in obtaining planning permission within the next 5 years. The amount of £5 million is therefore contingent on a future event (the granting of the planning permission within the 5 years following completion of the purchase). A Ltd must complete its LTT return showing declaring chargeable consideration of £15 million. A Ltd may choose to make an application to defer the tax arising on the amount of contingent consideration - £5 million.

 E Ltd (buyer) exchanges contracts with F Ltd to buy a plot of land for £10m plus an additional amount payable in 5 years, should the buyer obtain planning permission for a residential development, to be based on 20% of the increase in value of the land. This amount is uncertain (because the value of the additional consideration depends on the future value of land). E Ltd can make an application to defer the tax arising on the unascertained amount of consideration, because the amount is also uncertain.

340,340,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2450 Annuities," (section 21) Where the chargeable consideration for a land transaction is in the form of an annuity, which is: payable for life in perpetuity for an indefinite period, or for a period which exceeds 12 years the chargeable consideration will be taken to be a one-off payment comprising 12 year’s payments. If the payments vary, the 12 highest payments will be taken into account. However, the annual amount is not treated as varying from year to year if that variation is based on the retail prices index, the consumer prices index or any similar index used to express a rate of inflation (for example CPIH). Where the annual amounts payable are contingent, uncertain or unascertained, those amounts are to be established in the same manner as for other amounts of contingent, uncertain or unascertained consideration. It should be noted that a taxpayer may not request a deferral of payment of tax related to consideration that consists of an annuity. Where the chargeable consideration for the transaction consists of both: an annuity, and other contingent or uncertain consideration (other than rent), then a taxpayer can request to defer the tax on the consideration other than the annuity. A taxpayer will also not need to make a further return, or be able to claim a repayment in the event that a contingency ceases or the consideration is ascertained. The LTT return must be completed showing the amount of chargeable consideration calculated using these rules and made within the normal filing period (within 30 days following the effective date of the transaction).

341,341,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Chargeable transactions and chargeable consideration,LTTA/2460 Buyer is connected company – deemed market value rule," (Section 22)  These rules apply to all transfers between a vendor (whether an individual or company) and a company connected to them, when the company is the buyer. The chargeable consideration for such transfers will be not less than the market value at the effective date, of the property transferred, irrespective of the consideration (or lack of it) actually passing. Therefore, the rule that where there is no consideration given for the land transaction, it is exempt from charge to LTT, does not apply; rather it is replaced by the market value of the land and buildings. Where a company acquires land from a seller who is connected to the company or some or all of the consideration consists of the issue or transfer of shares in a company that the seller is connected to (including the buyer itself) then the chargeable consideration is: the market value of the subject-matter of the transaction at the effective date of the transaction, and if the acquisition is the grant of a lease at a rent, that rent Alternatively, if the amount of chargeable consideration given is greater than the market value rule expressed above then that actual chargeable consideration is assessable to LTT instead. However, any other relevant conditions that make the transaction exempt from charge, or any relief that may be claimable on the transaction, still apply to transactions where the buyer is a connected company. Additionally there are some specific rules that provide that market value will not be imposed. A company includes any body corporate (although in relation to a partnership that is also a body corporate the partnership rules will apply). References to shares also include stocks and securities issued by a company.

(Case 1) immediately after the transaction the company holds the property as trustee and the seller is only connected with the company by virtue of section 1122(6) of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. (Case 2) the seller is a company and the transaction is, or is part of, a distribution of assets, whether or not on the winding up of a company and the subject-matter of the transaction (or an interest from which the subject-matter of the transaction is derived) has not been the subject of a claim by the seller to group relief in the three years prior to the effective date of the transaction. (Case 3) However, where the seller has had that group relief withdrawn following the claim, the exclusion to the market value rule provided by Case 3 will apply. This is because the claim to the relief has been withdrawn at the effective date of the transaction to which the exclusion applies. If any of these exceptions apply, LTT will only be charged on the chargeable consideration paid.

344,344,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4010 Introduction," It should be noted that LTT is not charged on the net present value (‘NPV’) of the rents payable on the grant of a residential lease; the tax is only payable on the NPV of rents payable on the grant of non-residential and mixed leases. Special rules apply where rent paid on the grant of a mixed lease (a lease that includes both residential and non-residential property). Therefore, except where expressly stated, references to a lease should be read to mean a lease for non-residential property. 
 There are specific charging rules in LTT in relation to non-residential leases which result, on the grant of a lease, in both the rent payable and any consideration other than rent (commonly a premium) being charged to tax. For an assignment of a lease, generally, only the consideration given to acquire the lease is chargeable. This is because the rents will, in the main, have been taxed already (if they are above the 0% rate band for rents). Specific rules apply to charge an assignment as though it were the grant of a lease. 
 A lease is: 
 
 an interest or right in or over land for a term of years, or 
 any interest or right in or over land that can be ended by a notice of termination or immediately 
 
 However, both a licence to occupy land and a tenancy at will are exempt interests and therefore not chargeable to LTT.

345,345,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4020 Calculation of tax chargeable," (Part 5 Schedule 6) 
 Tax chargeable in respect of consideration other than rent 
 (paragraph 33) 
 Amounts paid as premium or other amounts paid as consideration other than rent for the grant or assignment of a lease are charged to LTT under the rules applicable to such consideration. 
 Where the grant of a lease or (where appropriate) an assignment of a lease that is to be treated as a grant of a lease, consists of both a consideration other than rent, and rents, the tax calculated under the relevant rules in respect to both are added together to create the amount that the taxpayer must self-assess. It should be noted that in certain cases the 0% rate band for consideration other than rent is removed from the calculation of tax. 
 Tax chargeable in respect to rent 
 (paragraph 29) 
 The amount of tax chargeable in respect of rent for a non-residential or mixed lease is calculated using 3 steps: 
 
 step 1 – calculate the net present value (‘NPV’) of the rent payable over the term of the lease 
 step 2 – for the amount of NPV rent falling into each tax band multiply that amount by the tax rate for that band 
 step 3 – add together the amounts for each tax band to give the total amount due 
 
 The calculation for establishing the amount of NPV can be found at  paragraph 31 to Schedule 6 LTTA(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/contents)  and for the temporal discount rate at  paragraph 32 of that schedule(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/contents) . Further guidance on the NPV calculation is available at  LTTA/4080(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6081) . 
 It should be noted that in certain cases the 0% rate band for consideration other than rent is removed from the calculation of tax. 
 The NPV should be calculated on the basis of the term of the lease. The online return, paper return and tax calculator will ask you whether you wish to use the effective date of the transaction or lease start date for the purposes of calculating the NPV. 
 The term of the lease generally starts on the later of: 
 
 the term commencement date (as specified in the lease), or 
 the date of the grant of the lease 
 
 The majority of leases will require the effective date of the transactions to calculate the NPV. However, there are certain cases where the legislation states that the term of the lease starts on a date earlier than the date of the grant of the lease. The most common of these scenarios are holdover leases ( LTTA/4060(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6062) ) and where a lease continues after a fixed term and a new lease is granted ( LTTA/4030(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6039)(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6039) ). In these types of transactions, you should therefore calculate the NPV using the lease start date rather than the effective date. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for 10 years, for no premium and NPV rents of £100,000. The transaction is not linked to any other transaction. That amount is in the 0% rate band, therefore £100,000 x 0% = £0. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is granted a lease for 10 years, for no premium and NPV rents of £500,000. The transaction is not linked to any other transaction. The amount of NPV in the 0% rate band is £225,000, and the amount in the 1% band is £275,000. The tax chargeable is therefore £275,000 x 1% = £2,750. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 C Ltd is granted a lease for 10 years, for no premium and NPV rents of £3,000,000. The transaction is not linked to any other transaction. The amount of NPV in the 0% rate band is £225,000, the amount in the 1% band is £1,775,000 (as the band is for rents more than £225,000 but not more than £2,000,000), and the amount in the 2% band is £1,000,000 (the rent so far not in any other band). The tax chargeable is therefore £1,775,000 x 1% = £17,750, and £1,000,000 x 2% = £20,000. The total tax payable is therefore £37,750.

 Tax chargeable in respect of consideration other than rent: no 0% band for non-residential leases 
 (paragraph 34)  
 Where a lease is granted, or treated as granted, for consideration of both rent and consideration other than rent, then if the amount of the annual rent is £9,000 or greater the 0% band for consideration other than rent does not apply to the premium etc. 
 The relevant rent threshold changed in February 2021. 
 For any transaction completed: 
 
 before 4 February 2021 the relevant rent threshold is £9,000 
 on or after 4 February 2021 the relevant rent threshold is £13,500 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd acquires a 10-year lease under the following terms; an annual rent of £3,000 plus consideration other than rent of £250,000. The NPV of the rents is £24,955. The annual rent is less than the amount of £13,500 so the rule is not triggered. Both the nil rate band for rent, and the nil rate band for consideration other than rent are available. Therefore, as the rents are in the 0% band there is no tax payable on that part of the consideration. The consideration other than rent is of an amount greater than the 0% band. The tax payable on that part of the consideration is £225,000 x 0% = £0 plus (£250,000-£225,000) x 1 % = £250. The LTT due is therefore £250.

The annual rent is equal to or more than the amount of £13,500 so the rule is triggered. The 0% band for rent is available but the 0% band for consideration other than rent is not available. The rents are in the 0% band there is no tax payable on that part of the consideration. The consideration other than rent is taxed as though the 1% band applied to consideration from not less than £0 to not more than £250,000. The tax payable on that part of the consideration is £250,000 x 1% = £2,500. The LTT due is therefore £2,500.

 Tax chargeable in respect of consideration other than rent: no 0% band for mixed leases 
 (paragraph 35) 
 Where the lease is for both residential and non-residential property, and there is consideration other than rent given, the lease is treated as though it were 2 separate but linked leases, one for residential property and one for non-residential property. 
 The rent payable in respect of the residential and non-residential property must be apportioned, on a just and reasonable basis, to determine whether the rent attributable to the non-residential property is greater than £13,500. This is the case where the rent is expressed as a single figure, but also where the lease specifies the rent payable for each property type. This ensures that the substance of the transaction is correctly taxed. 
 However, it should be noted that, for the purposes of calculating the tax due, the entire amount of rent is treated as chargeable consideration because the lease is a mixed lease by virtue of the 2 leases being linked. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Ms A is granted a lease for a period of 10 years on a 2-storey building. The top floor is a single residential property and the ground floor is a shop. The consideration given in the lease is £350,000 premium and annual rent of £35,000 per annum (with an NPV of £291,081). The lease does not set out the split between the consideration given for residential and the non-residential part of the property. 
 The rules require the transaction to be split into 2 separate but linked transactions; one that is for the residential property and one that is for the non-residential property. 
 The just and reasonable split between the residential part and the non-residential part is 1/5 for the residential part and 4/5 for the non-residential part. 
 The annual rent attributable, on a just and reasonable apportionment, to the non-residential rent is £35,000 x 4/5 = £28,000. This is greater than £13,500; therefore, the 0% band is not available for the consideration other than rent, in respect of the non-residential transaction. 
 The consideration other than rent, in respect of the non-residential transaction is £350,000 x 4/5 = £280,000. The consideration other than rent, in respect of the residential transaction is £350,000 X 1/5th = £70,000. 
 The linked transaction rules for consideration other than rent apply. The non-residential rates and bands apply as the transaction includes both residential and non-residential property. 
 The total tax due on the residential transaction under the linked transaction rule is treated as follows: The total consideration other than rent is £350,000. The 0% band for consideration other than rent for non-residential property applies. The tax payable is therefore £225,000 x 0% = £0, plus (£350,000-£225,000) x 1 % = £1,250. The relevant fraction from the just and reasonable split is 1/5, so the LTT in respect of the residential property is £250 (£1,250 X 1/5th = £250). 
 However, as explained above, the 0% band for consideration other than rent, is not available for the non-residential property (as the rent, justly and reasonably apportioned, is equal to or more than £13,500). The total tax due on the non-residential property under the linked transaction rule is £7,500 (£250,000 x 1% = £2,500 plus £350,000 - £250,000 x 5% = £5,000 to total £7,500), the relevant fraction is 4/5 resulting LTT for the non-residential transaction is £6,000 (£7,500 X 4/5ths = £6,000). 
 The NPV is not apportioned between the residential and non-residential transactions for the purpose of calculating the tax due as the transaction is treated as a mixed lease. The LTT due on the NPV of the rents, based on the non-residential and mixed use table for rents is therefore £660.81 (£0 to £225,000 x 0% plus £225,000 to £291,081 x 1%). 
 The total tax due on this transaction is £6,910.81 (£250 + £6,000 + £660.81). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Ms A is granted a lease for a period of 10 years on a 2-storey building. The top floor is a single residential property and the ground floor is a shop. The consideration given in the lease is £350,000 premium and annual rent of £35,000 per annum (with an NPV of £291,081). The lease does not set out the split between the consideration given for residential and the non-residential part of the property.

 The annual rent attributable, on a just and reasonable apportionment, to the non-residential rent is £35,000 x 4/5 = £28,000. This is greater than £13,500; therefore, the 0% band is not available for the consideration other than rent, in respect of the non-residential transaction.

 Tax chargeable in respect to rent: linked transactions 
 (paragraph 30) 
 Where the lease is a non-residential or a mixed lease and is one of a number of linked transactions, the amount of tax chargeable is calculated using the following steps: 
 
 step 1 – calculate the total of the net present values (‘TNPV’) of the rent payable over the terms of the linked leases, 
 step 2 – for each band applicable to the acquisition multiply so much of the TNPV that falls into each band by the tax rate for that band, 
 step 3 – calculate the total of the amounts reached under step 2. The result is the total tax chargeable in respect of rent for the linked leases, 
 step 4 – divide the NPV of the rent payable over the term of the lease in question by the TNPV,  
 step 5 – multiply the total tax chargeable in respect of rent by the fraction reached under step 4, 
 
 the result is the amount of tax chargeable in respect of rent for the lease in question.  
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease on a non-residential property by B Ltd. A Ltd indicates that it also wants to rent a second property from B Ltd. The particular facts of the case make the grant of the 2 leases linked even though they are separated by time both transactions completed in March 2021. The NPV on the first lease is £250,000 and the tax chargeable is £250. The grant of the second lease is a linked transaction. The NPV for the second lease is £300,000. 
 Following the steps set out above the tax liability is: 
 
 step 1 – TNPV is £550,000 
 step 2 – using the rates and bands in force at 22 December 2020 the tax liability is £0 to £225,000 x 0% = £0, plus, £225,000 to £550,000 x 1% = £3,250 
 step 3 – the sum of the amounts in step 2 total £3,250. 
 step 4 – the lease in question (the second lease) has an NPV of £300,000. This is divided by the TNPV. Therefore the sum is 300000/550000, giving a fraction of 6/11. 
 step 5 – multiply the total tax by the fraction - £3,250 x 6/11 = £1,772.73 
 
 The return for the most recent lease should self-assess a liability of £1,772.73. A further return for the earlier lease should also be sent by the filing date for the newly granted lease. This further return will need to use the same calculation as above for steps 1 to 3. Step 4, however, will use 250000/550000 to establish the fraction of 5/11. 
 Step 5 will establish a liability of £1477.27. As £250 was self-assessed and paid on the filing of the first return for this transaction the further return will need to self-assess the £1227.72 additional LTT now due on that transaction.

 Reversionary leases 
 A reversionary lease is a lease that is granted where the lease start date is a date in the future, i.e. the term of the lease begins after the date on which the lease was granted. 
 In these circumstances, the effective date of the transaction is the date of the grant of the lease, not the date on which the term of the lease begins. 
 The Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated on the basis of the rent payable over the term of the lease, where the start date is the later of: 
 
 the term commencement date (as specified in the lease) or 
 the date of the grant of the lease 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A reversionary lease is granted on 1 June 2019 and has a term from and including 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2025. As the lease has actually been granted, this is not an agreement to lease. The effective date of the transaction is the date that the lease is granted (in this case, 1 June 2019). The Net Present Value (NPV) will be calculated from the lease start date (in this case, 1 January 2020).

 Lease for a fixed term 
 (paragraph 2 Schedule 6) 
 If the lease is for a fixed term, that has a stated commencement and termination date (or where those dates can be established) then any contingency or right that could result in the lease being terminated before that termination date, or any right to renew the lease, are not taken into account in establishing the tax charge. 
 A lease for a fixed term can be expressed either as ‘from’ a date or ‘from and including’ a date. Therefore, a lease with a term of 10 years from 25 March 2020 begins on 26 March 2020 and ends on 25 March 2030. Whereas a lease with a term of 10 years from and including 25 March 2020 begins on 25 March 2020 and ends on 24 March 2030. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for 10 years from and including 1 January 2020. The landlord B Ltd has a right to terminate the lease on 31 December 2024 so long as notice is given before 30 September 2024. Despite this right to terminate, the lease will be treated as being for 10 years.

 Leases that continue after a fixed term 
 (paragraph 3 Schedule 6) 
 Leases granted for a fixed term ‘and thereafter until determined’ or for a fixed term that may continue beyond the fixed term ‘by operation of law’ are treated for LTT purposes as being for the fixed term stated on grant. Such leases include business tenancies within Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (‘LTA54’) which normally continue beyond the contractual term, until they are terminated or a new tenancy is granted. 
 A lease will not automatically continue beyond its contractual term if, for example, a business tenancy is contracted out of LTA54 or a business tenant loses the right to renew the lease. In many cases, a tenant remaining in occupation at the end of the contractual term of such a lease may, in strictness, be trespassing, or there may be a tenancy at will or a contractual license. If the tenant remains in occupation under these circumstances then there are no LTT implications and additional tax is not chargeable during the period the taxpayer remains in occupation. 
 However, there are LTT implications in cases where the lease is treated as continuing beyond its contractual term and rent remains payable, for example: 
 
 A business tenancy within Part II LTA54 normally continues beyond its contractual term until it is terminated or a new tenancy is granted. 
 At the end of a business tenancy which is contracted out of Part II LTA54, or where the right to renew is lost, a new implied lease may arise. 
 For most residential shorthold tenancies granted for an initial fixed term, the end of the contractual term is followed by a statutory periodic tenancy. 
 
 These leases are treated for LTT purposes as being for one year longer than the original term, irrespective of any other rule or operation of law which determines that they should be extended for a longer or shorter period. 
 Leases are therefore treated as: 
 
 Running for the length of the original fixed term. 
 If the lease continues after the end of the fixed term it is treated as a lease for a fixed term of one year longer than the original fixed term. 
 If the lease continues after this one year extension, it is treated as being extended by another year and so on until either a new lease is granted or the lease is determined. 
 If the lease actually terminates during any part year during the further periods set out in point 2 and 3 above, then the lease is treated as continuing to that termination date. 
 
 Where the increased net present value of the extended lease gives rise to a charge or additional charge to LTT, a return or further return is required. That return or further return must be made within 30 days of the day after the end of that extended period. The tax liability is based on the rates and bands in force at the date that the lease was initially granted (i.e. the effective date for the transaction). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd was granted a 5-year lease for a non-residential property commencing on 1 January 2020. The transaction is notifiable and a return is submitted. A Ltd stays in occupation following the end of the fixed period expressed in the lease (31 December 2024). At 31 December 2025 A Ltd is still in occupation and is now under an obligation to send in a further return by 30 January 2026 the additional tax will be calculated by treating the lease as though it was one originally for 6 rather than the original 5 years. The result of that calculation is deducted from the tax originally assessed to establish the additional amount payable. A Ltd continues in occupation and is still in occupation on 31 December 2026. A further return therefore needs to be submitted by 30 January 2027 with the additional tax calculated as though the lease were a 7 year lease. On 30 June 2027 the lease is terminated. A Ltd must therefore make a further return by 30 July 2027 with the additional tax calculated as though the lease were 7 years and 181 days long (i.e. from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2027). 
 It should be noted that leases for a fixed term that commenced under SDLT remain taxable to SDLT when they continue at the end of that fixed term.

The result of that calculation is deducted from the tax originally assessed to establish the additional amount payable. A Ltd continues in occupation and is still in occupation on 31 December 2026. A further return therefore needs to be submitted by 30 January 2027 with the additional tax calculated as though the lease were a 7 year lease. On 30 June 2027 the lease is terminated. A Ltd must therefore make a further return by 30 July 2027 with the additional tax calculated as though the lease were 7 years and 181 days long (i.e. from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2027). 
 It should be noted that leases for a fixed term that commenced under SDLT remain taxable to SDLT when they continue at the end of that fixed term.

 Leases that continue after a fixed term: grant of a new lease 
 (paragraph 4 Schedule 6) 
 Where the taxpayer has continued in occupation and the lease is treated as continuing after the fixed term for one, or more than one, year longer than the original fixed term but: 
 
 during any relevant one-year extended period the tenant is granted a new lease of the same, or substantially the same, premises 
 the term of that new lease begins in that year, and  
 the provisions relating to tenant holding over: new lease backdated to previous year do not apply 
 
 then the lease is not treated as continuing for that one-year extended period (or part of that one year), but rather the term of the new lease is treated as beginning with the day after the original fixed term ended (or any full year extended period as appropriate). This would be the lease start date. 
 Rent that is payable under the original lease in respect of that one-year (or part thereof) period is to be treated as payable under the new lease. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for a non-residential, from and including 1 April 2020 for a period of 3 years at an annual rent of £120,000 (payable quarterly). At the end of that fixed term (31 March 2023) A Ltd remained in occupation and continued to pay the same rent to its landlord. At 1 April 2024 A Ltd is still in occupation. It must make a further return to WRA by 30 April 2024 to pay the additional tax due on what is now treated as the grant of a 4-year lease. On 1 July 2024 A Ltd is granted a new 3-year lease, at £150,000 annual rent, by its landlord that commences from and includes 1 July 2024. As the new lease is granted in a year in which the original fixed term lease is treated as extended (and is not backdated to a previous year), the new lease is deemed to have commenced on 1 April 2024 and ending on 30 June 2027. It is therefore the grant of a lease for 3 years and 91 days. The rent for the first year of the lease will be £29,917 (the 91 days of the old lease rent of £120,000) plus £112,602 (274 days of the new lease annual rent of £150,000), a total of £142,519. The 2nd and 3rd year rents are £150,000 each and the final 3 months of rent is £37,397 (91/365x£150,000). The return for the newly granted lease must be made by 31 July 2024 (i.e. 30 days after the effective date of the transaction – the grant of the lease).

 Leases for an indefinite term 
 (paragraph 5 Schedule 6) 
 A lease for an indefinite term, that is any lease where the term of the lease cannot be solely ascertained from the wording of the lease or some other ancillary document (e.g. a periodic tenancy or a lease for life), is treated, when first granted as a lease for a fixed term of one year. If the lease should continue beyond the first year then it is treated as though it were a lease for a fixed term of 2 years. If it continues beyond the second year it is treated as a lease for a fixed term of 3 years and so on. 
 However, where a lease is not notifiable then the rules above will not apply until such point as the lease does become notifiable (for example if the term has reached 7 years, or there is tax chargeable at a rate of more than 0% etc.). It should be noted that a lease for an indefinite term is treated, when granted, as a lease for less than 7 years. 
 The filing obligations that a taxpayer is under will depend upon whether the grant of the lease is notifiable, or becomes so due to subsequent yearly extensions. 
 If the grant of the lease for an indefinite term (which is treated as a lease for a fixed term of one year) is a notifiable transaction, then the taxpayer must send a return to WRA before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day after the effective date of the transaction. When there is a lease extension, then the taxpayer is under an obligation to send in that additional return before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the day after the end of the longer term for which the return is treated as continuing. 
 If the land transaction only becomes notifiable due to a lease extension for a year at a later date, then the filing obligation arises at that point. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for an indefinite term that starts on 1 January 2020. It is notifiable, therefore A Ltd is under an obligation to make a return by 31 January 2020. That lease continues for a 2nd year. At the end of that second year the taxpayer is under an obligation to make a return (and pay the additional tax due), by 30 January 2022, i.e. before the end of 30 days following the end of the longer fixed term of one year. This rule then applies at the end of the 3rd year etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is granted a lease for an indefinite term that starts on 1 January 2020. It is not notifiable at that point because the lease is treated as being for less than a term of 7 years and there is no tax payable. The lease continues but, at the end of the second year it remains not notifiable. The lease continues for a 3rd year and at the end of that 3rd year the lease is notifiable because there is tax to pay based on the NPV of the 3 years rents. The taxpayer must therefore send in a return, and pay the tax due, by 30 January 2023. If the lease continues for further years then an annual obligation to make a return will arise. 
 In the event that the lease is treated as a lease for a fixed term of 2 or more years, and it terminates in the extended period; then the lease is treated as extended only until that date, and that date of termination creates an obligation on the taxpayer to make a return (if the land transaction is notifiable). This means that a lease that is granted for an indefinite term is treated, on grant, as having a term of at least one full year (but see below for cases where the lease terminates during that first year) and thereafter the taxpayer is assessed on the actual length of the term. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 C Ltd is granted a lease for an indefinite term that starts on 1 January 2020. The lease is for an annual rent amount of £100,000, and there is no consideration other than rent. The land transaction is, at this point not notifiable as the term is for less than 7 years and there is no tax payable and no relief has been claimed. The lease continues for a further year and is now a notifiable transaction as LTT is payable on the NPV of the 2 years rents. The taxpayer must make this return, and pay the tax, by 30 January 2022. On 30 June 2022 the lease terminates. The taxpayer is under an obligation to make a return to cover this further 6-month period and pay the necessary additional tax by 30 July 2022 (i.e. 30 days after the extended period ends). 
 In the event that a lease for an indefinite term terminates in the first year, and less tax would be payable as a result, then the taxpayer may amend their return within the period provided by TCM to make such an amendment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 D Ltd is granted a lease for an indefinite term that starts on 1 January 2020. The rent payable is £366,000 for that first year (i.e. £1,000 per day). The land transaction is notifiable and D Ltd must make a return and pay LTT based on the net present value of £353,623 by 31 January 2020. On 30 September 2020 the lease is terminated. The taxpayer may, by 31 January 2021, amend their return to show a NPV rent of £264,734, and claim repayment of the overpaid tax.

 Successive linked leases 
 A series of leases will often exist between the same parties; for example, where a short lease is renewed between the same tenant and landlord. A renewal lease will be treated as linked with the original lease if, for example, the rent was fixed under the terms of the original lease or is stated to be the same as that payable under the original lease. 
 Where leases of the same premises are granted: 
 
 between the same or connected parties 
 to take effect one immediately after the other 
 whether at the same time or not 
 
 these are successive linked leases for LTT purposes, with tax calculated as though the series of linked leases were a single lease. LTT is calculated as though the series of leases were one lease: 
 
 granted at the time the first lease in the series was granted 
 for a term equal to the aggregate of terms of all the leases in the series, and 
 in consideration of the rent payable under all of the leases in the series. 
 
 Successive leases that are not successive linked leases 
 A series of leases will often exist between the same parties; for example, where a short lease is renewed between the same tenant and landlord. A renewal lease will be treated as linked with the original lease if, for example, the rent was fixed under the terms of the original lease or is stated to be the same as that payable under the original lease. 
 However, the renewal of a lease will not be treated as linked with the original lease at all for LTT purposes if it can be shown (with appropriate evidence) to have been negotiated at arm’s length, for example if the original or earlier lease: 
 
 expired naturally 
 contained no right or compulsion of either party to renew, and/or 
 was renewed following entirely new negotiations, as would apply to a new tenant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a 3-year lease on 1 January 2020 for a rent of £70,000 per annum and includes in its terms the right to renew the lease for the same rent on expiry. There is no consideration given other than rent. On 1 January 2023 a new 3-year lease is granted between the same parties on the same terms. These are successive leases and LTT is calculated as though the series of leases were one lease: 
 
 granted at the time the first lease in the series was granted (1 January 2020) 
 for a term equal to the aggregate of terms of all the leases in the series (6 years), and 
 in consideration of the rent payable under all of the leases in the series (£70,000 per annum) 
 
 A Ltd’s filing obligations are for a return to be made by 31 January 2020 which is calculated on the NPV of £210,000 for a 3 year lease, and for a further return to be made by 31 January 2023 which will be calculated on the NPV of £420,000 for a 6 year lease. Only the additional tax will be payable for the further return.

These are successive leases and LTT is calculated as though the series of leases were one lease: 
 
 granted at the time the first lease in the series was granted (1 January 2020) 
 for a term equal to the aggregate of terms of all the leases in the series (6 years), and 
 in consideration of the rent payable under all of the leases in the series (£70,000 per annum) 
 
 A Ltd’s filing obligations are for a return to be made by 31 January 2020 which is calculated on the NPV of £210,000 for a 3 year lease, and for a further return to be made by 31 January 2023 which will be calculated on the NPV of £420,000 for a 6 year lease. Only the additional tax will be payable for the further return.

 Linked leases that are not successive linked leases 
 Transactions are defined as ‘linked’ for the purposes of LTT if they form: 
 
 a single scheme, arrangement, or 
 a series of transactions 
 
 between the same parties (or connected persons). 
 In the case of leases, the tax treatment differs depending on whether they are linked by way of a single scheme or arrangement or as a series of leases (‘successive’ linked leases). 
 Where, as a matter of fact, leases of 2 or more properties are negotiated as a single bargain between the same or connected parties, the transactions will be treated as linked for LTT purposes. If the special provisions for successive leases do not apply (see above), then tax on linked leases is calculated using special rules. 
 Linked leases: Calculation of tax liability 
 Where leases are linked for LTT purposes but the special provisions for successive leases do not apply (see above), then the rules for calculating LTT are modified as follows:- 
 
 Calculate the total tax that would be chargeable on the first lease if the linked transactions were a single transaction: 
 
 
 Calculate net present value (NPV) of first lease (NPV1) 
 Aggregate NPV1 with NPV of second lease (NPV2) to give total net present values (TNPV) of rent payable over the terms of both leases. This is the relevant rental value; 
 Calculate the total tax chargeable on the TNPV using the threshold relevant at the date of grant of the first lease 
 Calculate the element of this total amount of tax which relates to the first lease by applying the fraction: NPV1 ÷ TNPV to the total tax chargeable on the TNPV 
 
 
 Calculate the total tax that would be chargeable on the 2nd lease if the linked transactions were a single transaction:
	 
 Calculate net present value (NPV) of 2nd lease (NPV2) 
 Aggregate NPV1 with NPV2 to give TNPV of rent payable over the terms of both leases. This is the relevant rental value 
 Calculate the total tax chargeable on the TNPV using the threshold relevant at the date of grant of the second lease 
 Calculate the element of this total amount of tax which relates to the second lease by applying the fraction: 
 NPV2 ÷ TNPV to the total tax chargeable on the TNPV 
 
 
 
 The 2 separate tax calculations are needed to apply the LTT rates and thresholds appropriate to each lease. The leases are linked, and the NPVs of rents aggregated, for the purposes of applying the relevant thresholds and rates fairly and proportionately. Where there is a third etc. linked lease then the rules are applied in the same manner to those leases.

348,348,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4050 Rent for overlap period in case of grant of further lease," (paragraph 7 Schedule 6) 
 For the purposes of calculating the net present value (NPV) of rents under the new lease, any rent payable under the new lease for any period falling within the overlap period is reduced by the rent which would have been payable (and has already been taken into account for LTT purposes, or SDLT purposes where transitional rules apply) for the overlap period. This is the case where: 
 
 a lease is surrendered (or treated as surrendered) and, as consideration for the surrender, a new lease is granted for the same or substantially the same premises 
 a tenant under a lease to which Part 2 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 applies requests a new tenancy which is then executed 
 a head lease is terminated and a sub-tenant is granted a new lease for the same or substantially the same premises as the sub-tenant held previously because of the order of a court or a contractual entitlement arising from the head lease being terminated 
 a guarantor for a tenant whose lease has been terminated is, in pursuance of the guarantee, granted a lease for the same or substantially the same premises 
 a lease of a building which is varied, for example, where additional floors are added to a building held on the old lease such that the variation gives rise to a surrender and re-grant of the lease 
 
 However, the reduction of the rents payable due to the overlap relief does not, potentially, result in no tax being payable for the new lease due to the normal rule that rents are calculated on the highest rent paid in any 12-month period in the first 5 years. This is because otherwise it would be possible for a lease to be granted for 10 years, tax paid on the NPV rents, and then that lease surrendered and re-granted at, say, year 3 for a considerably longer time but with the same rent. As overlap relief would be available for the first 5 years of the new lease (effectively meaning rent payable in the first 5 years was £0 per annum for the new lease) that £0 rent would be treated as the rent for the whole of the term of the new lease. The rules, however, do not permit that to occur, and whilst overlap relief is properly given for the years that have already been assessed to LTT, the later years where ‘new’ rent is payable will still attract LTT on the NPV of the rents. 
 The overlap period is the period common to the terms of both the new and old lease. It is the period from the date that the new lease is granted to the date that the old lease would have ended (for LTT purposes) had it not been terminated. This includes extensions to lease terms following the end of a fixed term, or an indefinite lease. 
 The rent which would have been payable under the old lease is that which was taken into account in calculating NPV for LTT self-assessment on the acquisition of the old lease. 
 Overlap relief cannot reduce the rent payable under the new lease to a negative amount. In other words, the amount of rent to be used in the NPV calculation for any year cannot be less than nil. 
 It should be noted that: 
 
 overlap relief is available where the old lease was subject to SDLT under the transitional rules or LTT. Where the old lease was subject to stamp duty, all rent payable under the new lease should be included in the NPV calculation for the new lease, irrespective of any overlap period, because no rent has been taken into account for SDLT or LTT purposes 
 no overlap relief is available where a lease was the subject of an SDLT or LTT exemption, or relief has been claimed, and is subsequently surrendered and replaced by a new lease which does not meet the conditions for relief. No rent was taken into account in determining the amount of tax due on the first lease so there can be no entitlement to this relief 
 where the rent is variable then overlap relief is disregarded and the ‘highest rent’ is the rent determined before any reduction for overlap relief 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease on a non-residential property on 1 April 2020. The term of the lease is for 5 years (contractual termination date is 31 March 2025). When the lease terminates, A Ltd remains in occupation. A new lease is granted on 1 October 2027 for the same premises for a further 5 years with the term expressed as starting on 1 April 2025. The relevant conditions are all met: the tenant remained in occupation following termination of the lease (31 March 2025), a new lease is granted for the same property, the date of grant (1 October 2027) is more than one year after the contractual termination date, and the lease is expressed as beginning on a date that is between the contractual termination date and the and the latest anniversary of that date (31 March 2027). 
 A Ltd will have made its first return for the grant of the old lease on or before 1 May 2020. When it remained in occupation of the property following the termination of the lease it will have made a return for the first full year (1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026) of its continued occupation on or before 30 April 2026. It will also have had to make a return for its second full year of occupation by 30 April 2027. Both these returns must be made in line with the requirements for leases that continue after a fixed term. No return under the leases that continue after a fixed term rules is required for the period 1 April 2027 to 1 October 2027 as the rent payable in this period has not yet been taxed and it will be taxed in the return for the new lease. The return for the new lease will be for the period of 5 years commencing on 1 April 2025 and ending on 31 March 2030. The taxable rents assessed for the 2 years ended 31 March 2027 are deducted from the rents payable for the 2 years of the new lease (so long as that does not result in negative figure). The rents for the remaining 3 years of the new lease will be based on the rents payable under the terms of that new lease.

 Meaning of ‘substantially the same’ 
 What constitutes “substantially the same property” is ultimately a question of fact. The overlap relief is intended to ensure that the taxpayer does not pay tax on the same land for the same period twice. For example, overlap relief would apply where a lease for half of a building was surrendered and replaced by a lease for all of the same building. 
 Overlap Relief: Rent taken into account 
 What is included in the term ‘rent taken into account’ on completion of a lease following substantial performance? 
 LTT is due on substantial performance of an agreement for lease, based on the rents for the first 5 years. If the rent increases in year 6 it is ignored in the calculation of the NPV. 
 Where a lease is subsequently granted after substantial performance, if there have been no changes to the terms of the lease (i.e. by variation etc.) the increased rent in year 6 has been ‘taken into account’ on substantial performance in relation to the grant of the lease. 
 Therefore, if there are no changes between substantial performance and completion there can be no additional LTT to pay. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease on 1 April 2020 for 25 years (the ‘old lease’). The terms of the lease are: 
 
 the date of expiry is 31 March 2045 
 rent of £144,000 per annum is payable under this old lease 
 there is no consideration other than rent 
 the net present value (NPV) of the old lease is £2,373,337 
 LTT is payable on the NPV figure (subject to any nil rate band) 
 
 The old lease is surrendered and a new lease is granted on 1 April 2024 for 150 years. The terms of the new lease are varied from the old lease so that rent of £110,000 per annum is now payable. Again, there is no consideration other than rent. 
 The tax payable under the new lease, (and allowing for the overlap relief) is established as follows: 
 
 The overlap period is calculated – in this case it is from 1 April 2024 until 31 March 2041, that is, 21 years.  
 The annual rent payable under the new lease is established – in this case it is £110,000. 
 The rent payable under the old lease is established – in this case £144,000. This is the amount included in the first NPV calculation. 
 The new lease is not a lease with variable rent. Therefore, the rent is known and the NPV calculation should use rent of £0 for years 1 to 21 inclusive (as the old rent is more than the new rent but the figure to be included in the calculation cannot be less than £0) and rent of £110,000 for years 22 to 150 inclusive to give a NPV of £1,508,038. The additional LTT is calculated on that NPV amount using the rates and thresholds for the date of the grant of the new lease.

 LTT is payable on the NPV figure (subject to any nil rate band) 
 
 The old lease is surrendered and a new lease granted 1 April 2024 for 150 years. The terms of the new lease are varied from the old lease so that rent of £175,000 per annum is now payable. Again there is no consideration other than rent. 
 The tax payable under the new lease (and allowing for the overlap relief) is established as follows: 
 
 The overlap period is from 1 April 2024 until 31 March 2045, that is, 21 years. 
 The rent payable under the new lease is £175,000. 
 3.The rent payable under the old lease is £144,000. This is the amount included in the first NPV calculation. 
 The new lease is not a lease with variable rent. Therefore, the NPV calculation should use rent of £31,000 for years 1 to 21 inclusive (being new rent £175,000 less old rent £144,000) and rent of £175,000 for years 22 to 150 inclusive to give a total NPV of £2,854,789. The additional LTT is calculated on that NPV amount using the rates and thresholds for the date of the grant of the new lease.

 The tax payable under the new lease (and allowing for the overlap relief) is established as follows: 
 
 The overlap period is from 1 October 2024 until 31 March 2045, that is, 21 years and 6 months. 
 The rent payable under the new lease is £110,000. 
 The rent payable under the old lease is £144,000. This is the amount included in the first NPV calculation. 
 The new lease is not a lease with variable rent. Therefore, the NPV calculation should use rent of £0 for years 1 to 20 inclusive (as the old rent is more than the new rent but the figure to be included in the calculation cannot be less than £0), £55,000 for year 21 (as the first 6 months of this year are in the overlap period comparison is made on a month by month or day by day basis to calculate the overlap relief. In the first 6 months of this year, the old rent is more than the new rent but the figure to be included in the calculation cannot be less than £0 for this 6 months. In the following 6 months the rent payable under the new lease is £55,000 and there is no overlap. Thus, the rent to include in the calculation for year 21 of the new lease is £0 + £55,000 = £55,000) and rent of £110,000 for years 22 to 150 inclusive to give an NPV of £1,534,745. The additional LTT is calculated on that NPV amount, using the rates and thresholds for the date of the grant of the new lease.

 the new lease is not a lease with variable rent. Therefore, the NPV calculation should use rent of £31,000 for years 1 to 20 inclusive (being new rent £175,000 less old rent £144,000), £103,000 for year 21 (as the first 6 months of this year are in the overlap period, comparison is made on a month by month or day by day basis to calculate the overlap relief. In the first 6 months of this year, the new rent is £87,500 less old rent of £72,000 to give £15,500. In the following 6 months the rent payable under the new lease is £87,500 (£175,000 / 12 months X 6 months) and there is no overlap. Thus, the rent to include in the calculation for year 21 of the new lease is £15,500 + £87,500 = £103,000) and rent of £175,000 for years 22 to 150 inclusive to give NPV of £2,889,750.

Therefore, the rent is known and the NPV calculation should use rent of £0 for years 1 to 21 inclusive (as the old rent is more than the new rent but the figure to be included in the calculation cannot be less than £0) and rent of £110,000 for years 22 to 150 inclusive to give a NPV of £1,508,038.

 Where: 
 
 a tenant under a lease (‘the old lease’) continues in occupation after the date the lease was to terminate (‘the contractual termination date’) 
 the tenant is granted a lease of the same or substantially the same premises (‘the new lease’) 
 the new lease is granted on a date that is more than one year after the contractual termination date, and 
 the term of the new lease begins on a date that is in the period that starts with the contractual termination date and ends with the latest anniversary date that is before the date on which the lease is granted. This period provides the ‘whole years of holdover’ 
 
 The term of the new lease is treated as beginning on the date it is expressed in the lease (lease start date). 
 In this case, where the return asks you to enter the effective date of the transaction, this will be the effective date of the new lease. 
 The rent payable under the new lease, in relation to the period which begins with the date the new lease is expressed as commencing on and ending with the last whole year of holdover, is treated as being reduced by the amount of the taxable rents paid during the holdover period. That cannot, though, create a negative rent figure. 
 The holdover tenancy is treated as a lease for a fixed term with a termination date that ends on the last date of a whole year holdover period. A holdover tenancy in these circumstances means: the old lease if it continues beyond the contractual termination date, or, any other tenancy of the same (or substantially the same) premises in which the tenant continues in occupation after the contractual termination date.

 Rent 
 (paragraph 9 Schedule 6) 
 Chargeable consideration for a lease or other chargeable transaction which wholly or partly consists of rent is chargeable to LTT. 
 Whether consideration consists of rent is a question of fact. Consideration may be treated as rent for LTT purposes despite being otherwise described; for example, as a license or fee in an agreement for lease. Conversely, a service charge may be reserved as rent in the lease but not treated as such for LTT purposes. 
 ‘Rent’ does not include consideration payable before a new lease is granted. In most circumstances, such payments prior to the grant of the lease may be taxed as a premium. 
 A nominal rent is not chargeable consideration for LTT purposes if it: 
 
 is expressed as a peppercorn or similar, or 
 has a net present value (NPV) of less than £1 
 
 Rent: Inclusive of services etc. 
 Service charges payable from tenant to landlord are not chargeable consideration for LTT purposes and are excluded from the calculation of tax as long as the payment of the service charge has been either: 
 
 provided for in the lease as a separate figure, or 
 expressed in the lease as part of an inclusive rent payment and apportioned on a just and reasonable basis 
 
 The fact that a service charge is reserved in the lease as rent does not make it rent for LTT purposes. 
 Where apportionment of an inclusive figure is necessary, this must be made on a just and reasonable basis and will not necessarily be the same as the apportionment (if any) set out in the lease documentation. 
 Where a single sum is payable in respect of rent, or rent and service charges, and: 
 
 there is no apportionment between rent and service charge, and/or 
 the service charge is not separately provided for in the terms of the lease, then the sum is to be treated entirely as rent for LTT purposes 
 
 Service charges are the most common item of non-chargeable consideration for a lease, but the above treatment applies equally to other non-chargeable consideration. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease. The term of a lease is for 4 years with rent of £10,000 per quarter payable. The landlord has agreed that this will include payment for services, but this is not expressly provided for in the lease. 
 The fact that a service charge is reserved in the lease as rent does not necessarily make it rent for LTT purposes. However, in this case the service charge has not been provided for in the terms of the lease, either as a separate figure or as part of an inclusive figure of rent which is apportioned. 
 All the £40,000 annual rent is therefore treated as rent. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is granted a lease. The term of a lease is for 4 years with rent of £10,000 per quarter payable inclusive of services. 
 Although the rent amount is expressed in the lease as being inclusive of services, no apportionment has been made between the 2 elements. 
 A just and reasonable apportionment for LTT purposes need not be made in the lease itself. The landlord tells B Ltd that the services that it provides have a cost of £2,000 per quarter. The evidence indicates that a just and reasonable apportionment is therefore £8,000 per quarter for rent and £2,000 per quarter for services. B Ltd should retain the evidence on which the apportionment is based. 
 Therefore, the annual rent for LTT purposes is £32,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 C Ltd is granted a lease. The term of a lease is for 4 years with rent of £10,000 per quarter payable inclusive £2,500 for services. This represents a fair amount for services as the market rent for a similar property without services would be £7,500 per quarter. 
 Although the whole £10,000 quarterly is reserved as rent, a distinct amount is identified in the lease as being for services and this apportionment is on a just and reasonable basis. 
 The annual rent for LTT purposes is £30,000.

 Although the quarterly rent of £10,000 is expressed as being both for rent and services and there is an apportionment, this is not on a just and reasonable basis. In such cases, the LTT legislation provides for tax to be calculated on the basis of a just and reasonable apportionment.

351,351,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4080 Rent for calculation of net present value," (paragraph 10) 
 The rent used to establish the net present value (‘NPV’) of the rents is based on the first 5 years of the lease. The NPV can be established using  the calculator(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator) . 
 NPV is an amount based on the sum of the rent payable over the term of the lease, with some adjustments, as follows: 
 
 
 The actual rent payable for any “rent year” is reduced by dividing the rent payable by a factor of (1 + the temporal discount rate) to the power of the rent year (see  paragraph 32 of Schedule 6 LTTA the temporal discount rate(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/schedule/6/paragraph/32) ). 
 For example, the formula to calculate the 2nd year NPV of a lease is: 
 rent / (1 + temporal discount rate)2 = NPV 
 
 
 Where the lease is longer than 5 years the annual amount of rent for those additional years is assumed to equal the highest rent payable in any consecutive 12-month period in the initial 5 years. 
 For example, where: 
 
 the rent payable in rent year 7 of a lease is £70,000, and 
 the highest rent payable in any 12-month period in the first 5 years of that lease is £50,000. 
 
 
	The calculation for the 7th year of an NPV calculation is: 
 £50,000 / (1 + temporal discount rate)7 = NPV 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for a term of 10 years. The annual rent is fixed in the lease and there are no review dates for the first 3 years of £35,000 each year, the next 3 years at a rent of £45,000 each year and the final 4 years at a rent of £55,000 each year. 
 In calculating the NPV the first 5 years are taken into account on the basis of actual rent paid. A Ltd has paid annual rents of £35,000, £35,000, £35,000, £45,000 and £45,000. The highest rent in any 12-month consecutive period in the first 5 years is £45,000. The rent for the remaining term of the lease is based on that annual rent of £45,000. In this case the NPV is £346,230. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is granted a lease for a term of 10 years. The annual rent is fixed in the lease and there are no review dates for the first 2 ½ years of £40,000 per annum, the next 12 months at a rent of £70,000 (there is a significant sporting event occurring), the next 3 ½ years at a rent of £45,000 each year and the final 3 years at a rent of £50,000 each year. 
 In calculating the NPV the first 5 years are taken into account on the basis of actual rent paid. A Ltd has paid annual rents of £40,000, £40,000, £55,000 ((£40,000/2)+(£70,000/2)), £57,500 ((£70,000/2)+(£45,000/2)) and £45,000. The highest rent in any 12-month consecutive period in the first 5 years is £70,000. The rent for the remaining term of the lease is based on that annual rent of £70,000. In this case the NPV is £479,700.

352,352,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4090 Variable and uncertain rent: calculation of net present value," (paragraph 10) 
 Where the rent is uncertain, unascertainable or contingent, the taxpayer must use reasonable assumptions or estimates to determine rent for the purposes of the calculation. This will include cases where the variation provided for in the lease, cannot be quantified at the date of grant of the lease; for example, where rents are to be reviewed in line with market rents or business results at a future date. Such rents are uncertain or unascertainable. Similarly, where the rent may vary as a result of a rent review in the first 5 years, the rents will be treated as variable. 
 Leases may also provide for the level of rent payable to be wholly or partly dependent upon an unknown outcome, such as the granting of planning permission. Such rents are contingent. Where the rent is contingent, NPV for the first 5 years is calculated on the basis that any contingent amount will be payable (or will not cease to be payable). 
 The rules relating to contingent, uncertain and unascertained consideration apply equally to rents. Also, it is not possible to apply for deferment of payment of LTT in respect of rent if some of the rent is contingent or unascertained as rent is specifically excluded from the ‘deferrable amount’ calculation. 
 Where the rent is to be increased in line with the retail prices index, or other index, to express inflation; that uncertain increase is ignored for the purposes of establishing the rents payable in the first 5 years of the term of the lease. In such cases the rent amount expressed in the lease, is the rent to be used to calculate the NPV. But, if the rent increases are expressed as, for example, RPI plus 2%, the whole of that rent increase is to be treated as uncertain and adjustments made. 
 For the purposes of calculating the NPV or the first 5 years, a reasonable estimate should be made of the amounts that will be payable. This need not necessarily be a professional valuation, but evidence of the basis of the estimate must be kept in case of an enquiry. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd is granted a lease for 7 years. The rent for the first 3 years is fixed at £50,000. There is a rent review at the end of years 3 and 6. The rent review in year 3 concludes on 1 August (7 months into year 3). It concludes that the rent is to be £60,000 for the 3 years leading up to the next rent review at the end of year 6. The taxpayer will have calculated the rent payable under the lease for the first 3 years at £50,000 per annum. For the next 2 years, and the remainder of the term of the lease, they will have used an estimate to the best of their judgment (in this case A Ltd considers on the facts, that the rent will increase to £57,000 in the first rent review). They therefore calculate the NPV using 3 years with rent of £50,000 and 2 years with rent of £57,000 (with £57,000 used to calculate the NPV for years after year 5). In this case the NPV is £328,197. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is opening a new shop and has been granted a lease for a term of 7 years. The lease is a turnover lease, with the rents expressed as a 4% percent of the sales net of VAT or a minimum of £40,000 per annum. The actual rent based on the turnover must be paid to the landlord 3 months after the year end (31 December). B Ltd has projected its net turnover for the first 5 years to be £750,000, £900,000, £1,200,000, £1,300,000 and £1,300,000. The return on the grant of the lease should use the following rent figures £40,000 (as it is higher than £750,000 x 4%), £40,000 (as it is higher than £900,000 x 4%), £48,000 (£1,200,000 x 4%), £52,000 (£1,200,000 x 4%), and £52,000. The highest amount in any 12-month consecutive period is also £52,000 which is used to calculate the NPV for years 6 and 7. In this case the NPV is £291,552.

 Variable or uncertain rent: Rent reviews 
 Where the terms of a lease provide for a rent review within the first 5 years, or the rent is otherwise uncertain or unascertained, the rent is variable and uncertain at the date of grant. For the purposes of calculating NPV for the first 5 years, a reasonable estimate should therefore be made of the amount payable. This need not necessarily be a professional valuation, but evidence of the basis of the estimate must be kept in case of a WRA inquiry. 
 First Rent Review in final quarter of 5th year 
 (paragraph 11) 
 A rent review is treated as falling after the end of the fifth year of the lease term, so is effectively disregarded for LTT purposes, if: 
 
 it is the first or only review 
 review is to an amount which is uncertain at the date of grant of the lease 
 the review date is 5 years after a specified date (for example, the ‘start date’ of a lease predating grant), and 
 the specified date falls within 3 months before the beginning of the lease term. 
 
 The outcome of the first rent review during the term of a lease will therefore be ignored if that rent review is after the date 4 years and 9 months from the start of the lease term. 
 The legislation refers to a ‘specified date’ so this provision only applies where the 5-year review is provided for in the terms of the lease. 
 Adjustment where rent determined on reconsideration date 
 (paragraph 12) 
 Where the rents payable are contingent, uncertain or unascertained, and a reconsideration date is reached, the taxpayer must determine the amount of rent payable for the first 5 years of the lease. The reconsideration date is the date falling at the end of the 5th year of the term of the lease, or, any earlier date on which the amount of rent payable in respect of the first 5 years of the term of the lease ceases to be uncertain. This will mean that a taxpayer should need to make one additional return in relation to the lease rents. 
 In relation to contingent rent the amount ceases to be uncertain when the contingency occurs, or it is clear that it will not occur. For uncertain or unascertained rent, it is when that amount becomes ascertained. 
 Underpayment of tax where rent determined on reconsideration date 
 (paragraph 13) 
 If as a result of the reconsideration date establishing the rents payable for the first 5 years of the term of the lease results in either a land transaction becoming notifiable, or additional LTT is payable then a return or further return must be made before the end of 30 days beginning with the reconsideration date. 
 Where the reconsideration date arises as a result of the date falling at the end of the fifth year of the lease the taxpayer is required to make a return within 30 days of that date. However, at such a point, for example for a turnover lease, it is possible that the rents remain uncertain. In such a case the taxpayer must, if the land transaction becomes notifiable or additional tax is payable, still send in a return within 30 days of the end of the 5th year of the lease. That return will need to be made to the best of the taxpayer‘s judgment, for example where the first 4 years rents are now known but the 5th is unknown, the return should be made including the actual rent for those 4 years and an updated estimate for the 5th year based. 
 Following submission of that return, the taxpayer has 12 months from the filing date of the return within which to amend the return to provide an accurate figure for rents payable. The amendment to the return must be made in accordance with the relevant rules. This rule is to ensure that there is a fixed date by which time the tax payable on the lease is final. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 The facts are the same as for B Ltd in the calculation of the NPV where the rents are uncertain. B Ltd establishes its turnover by 31 March each year so that it can make a correcting payment to its landlord. The actual turnover for the first 4 years, which are known at the date falling at the end of the 5th year of the term of the lease are £825,000, £950,000, £1,250,000, and £1,400,000. The actual rents payable are rent figures £40,000 (as it is higher than £825,000 x 4%), £40,000 (as it is higher than £950,000 x 4%), an increase to £50,000 (£1,250,000 x 4%), an increase to £56,000 (£1,400,000 x 4%). The year 5 turnover is not yet established, therefore B Ltd must make an estimate to the best of its judgment. B Ltd based on the figures so far available for the fifth year believes that the turnover will be marginally higher at £1,425,000 (rent of £57,000). The NPV is therefore £309,049 with the rent for the years after year 5 based on the last years rent (which is also the highest 12 month consecutive period in the first 5 years as well). A return is sent in by the filing date which is 30 days after the reconsideration date (in this case the reconsideration date is 31 December 2024, so the filing date is 30 days after that date – 30 January 2025). 
 By 31 March 2015 B Ltd establishes that the rents in the 5th are lower than expected at £1,390,000 (rent of £55,600). B Ltd must make an amendment to the further return to reflect the actual rent payable in year 5. As a result the rent for the years after year 5 also need to be changed as the highest rent in the first 5 years is now that paid in year 4 rather than the previous estimate used for year 5. The NPV is therefore £308,072. A repayment will be made by WRA of the overpayment of tax. 
 In the event that the rents had increased over the year 5 estimate then the return would need to be amended to reflect this fact and additional tax paid by B Ltd.

 The facts are the same as for B Ltd in the calculation of the NPV where the rents are uncertain. B Ltd establishes its turnover by 31 March each year so that it can make a correcting payment to its landlord. The actual turnover for the first 4 years, which are known at the date falling at the end of the 5th year of the term of the lease are £825,000, £950,000, £1,250,000, and £1,400,000. The actual rents payable are rent figures £40,000 (as it is higher than £825,000 x 4%), £40,000 (as it is higher than £950,000 x 4%), an increase to £50,000 (£1,250,000 x 4%), an increase to £56,000 (£1,400,000 x 4%).

 Overpayment of tax where rent determined on reconsideration date 
 (paragraph 14) 
 If as a result of the reconsideration date there is less LTT payable the taxpayer may make an amendment to the return where that is possible or if they cannot make an amendment to the return may make a claim to WRA for repayment of the LTT overpaid. 
 An amendment to the return must, generally, be made within 12 months of the filing date for the return. The amendment must therefore be made within 13 months of date the lease was granted. 
 The rules relating to the date by which a claim must be made are extended for claims made relating to an overpayment where the rent is determined on a reconsideration date. The repayment claim can be made within the period of 4 years after the filing date for the original return or, if later, a period of 12 months beginning with the reconsideration date. Where the reconsideration date is the date falling at the end of the 5th year of the term of the lease the later rule will apply, giving the taxpayer 12 months from the reconsideration date to make their claim for repayment. Claims made after that period will not be repaid. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Y Ltd was granted a 10 year lease on 1 April 2025. It filed a return based on its best judgment of the rent payable on the filing date of 1 May 2025. The rents are uncertain and will only be ascertainable at the end of the first 5 years of the lease. The reconsideration date is therefore 31 March 2030. Y Ltd establishes that it overestimated the rents payable over the first 5 years of the term of the lease and is due a repayment. It cannot make an amendment to the return made on 1 May 2025 as the 12 month period for doing so has passed. It must therefore make a claim to WRA for repayment of the LTT. The claim must be made by the later of 1 May 2029 (4 years from the filing date for the return to which the claim relates) or 31 March 2030 (12 months after the reconsideration date). If Y Ltd makes its claim by 31 March 2031 WRA will make repayment (if it accepts there has been an overpayment). If the claim is made after that date the repayment will not be made.

 Premium – consideration other than rent 
 The term ‘premium’ is not used in the LTT legislation, despite being a common term for consideration given for a lease that is not rent. Instead the expression ‘consideration other than rent’ (e.g. a premium) is used. 
 Consideration given by a tenant to a landlord for the grant of a lease will be chargeable to LTT as a premium, unless it is by way of rent (or otherwise exempt from charge). 
 Chargeable consideration for the grant of a lease which is in respect of a period before the lease is granted is not rent for LTT purposes, even if it is described as such, and may be taxed as consideration other than rent. 
 Premium payments for a lease are charged to LTT in the same way as other chargeable consideration; for example, the payment of an amount to acquire a freehold interest. 
 Where both a premium and rent are payable for the grant of a lease, the tax due on the 2 elements of consideration will be calculated separately and added together to determine the total LTT payable. It should be noted that, where a taxpayer is granted a lease that includes both rent and a premium, there are special rules which may apply. If the special rules apply, the taxpayer will not be entitled to the zero rate threshold for the amount paid as the premium. 
 Reverse premiums – not chargeable consideration 
 (paragraph 15 Schedule 6) 
 A reverse premium is defined as: 
 
 A premium paid by a landlord to a tenant in relation to the grant of a lease, or 
 A premium paid by the assignor to the assignee in relation to the assignment of a lease, or 
 A premium paid by the tenant to the landlord in relation to the surrender of a lease. 
 
 Such payments are not chargeable consideration for the purposes of LTT. 
 Tenants’ obligations - not chargeable consideration 
 (paragraph 16) 
 When a new lease is granted, the following are not counted as chargeable consideration: 
 
 any undertaking by the tenant to repair, maintain or insure the premises 
 any undertaking by the tenant to pay any amount for services, repairs, maintenance or insurance or the landlord’s costs of management 
 any other obligation undertaken by the tenant that is not such as to affect the rent that a tenant would pay in the open market 
 any guarantee of the payment of rent or the performance of any other obligation of the tenant under the lease 
 any penal rent, or increased rent in the nature of a penal rent, payable in respect of the breach of any obligation of the tenant under the lease; 
 payment by a tenant of a landlord’s costs under the statutory provisions governing the enfranchisement or extension of leases of flats and long leases of houses, or an obligation to pay such costs 
 payment by a tenant of a landlord’s other reasonable costs on or incidental to the grant of a lease, or an obligation to pay such costs 
 any obligation under the lease to transfer to the landlord payment entitlements granted to the tenant under the Single Payment Scheme (agricultural leases). 
 
 Payment by a tenant in discharge of any of the obligations noted above is not chargeable consideration. 
 The above payments are not chargeable consideration even if they are reserved as rent under the terms of the lease. However, where a single sum is provided for in the lease, to cover (for example) both rent and service charge, the amount excluded from chargeable consideration must be calculated based on a just and reasonable apportionment. 
 Equally, on the surrender of a lease, payment to release a tenant from any of the above obligations, is also not chargeable consideration. 
 Surrender of existing lease in return for new lease 
 (paragraph 17) 
 Where a lease is granted in consideration of the surrender of an existing lease between the same tenant and landlord, the respective grant and surrender are not chargeable consideration for each other and the exchange rules do not apply. 
 
Assignment of lease – assumption of obligations by new owner 
 (paragraph 18) 
 Where a lease is assigned; the assumption of obligations under that lease by the new tenant to pay rent or to perform or observe any undertakings set out in the lease, do not count as chargeable consideration. 
 Deposit and loan in connection with grant or assignment of lease 
 (paragraph 19) 
 Where a tenant (or a person connected to them) makes a loan, or pays a deposit (whether to the landlord or to a third party), the repayment of which is contingent on anything to be done or not to be done by the tenant: 
 
 the amount of the loan or deposit is to be treated as consideration other than rent (premium) paid by the tenant for the grant of the lease; 
 except where the amount of the deposit does not exceed twice the relevant maximum rent (being the highest rent payable in respect of any continuous 12-month period during the first 5 years of the term of the lease); under these circumstances the loan or deposit it is ignored for the purposes of LTT. 
 
 The same provisions apply to loans made, or deposits paid, by an assignee in connection with the assignment of a lease. In this case, the relevant maximum rent is the highest rent payable in respect of any continuous 12-month period during the first 5 years of the term that remains of the lease, at the assignment date. 
 The relevant maximum rent is, in both a grant and an assignment, established without reference to situations where there is an overlap between 2 leases or return periods and credit is given to reduce the overlap. The reduced amount of rent as a result of the overlap credit is ignored and the rents under the term of the lease are used to establish the relevant maximum rent.

353,353,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,"LTTA/4100 Agreements for lease, assignments and variations"," Agreement for lease 
 (paragraph 20) 
 A lease is often preceded by an agreement for lease. Although this may operate in law as an equitable lease, for LTT it is treated as a contract which is not chargeable to LTT if: 
 
 entering into an agreement for lease does not in itself constitute a land transaction under the LTT rules, or 
 if the agreement is not ‘substantially performed’ before the lease itself is concluded, the agreement is treated as part of the same transaction as the lease and the effective date will be that of the lease itself 
 
 However, if a written agreement is ‘substantially performed’ before the lease is concluded, it may itself be treated as the grant of a ‘notional lease‘, with the effective date being that of substantial performance. 
 The effective date of the transaction for a notional lease is the date of substantial performance of the agreement. An agreement for lease is completed by the grant of a lease in conformity with the agreement (this is the ‘actual lease’). 
 When an actual lease is granted, the notional lease is treated as if it were a lease that had been granted on the date it had been substantially performed; for a term beginning on that date (lease start date), and ending on the end date of the actual lease, and in consideration for the rent paid over that (longer) term. 
 When these circumstances arise the grant of the actual lease is disregarded, except in relation to the requirement for a further return in relation to the notional lease to be submitted, as a result of the actual lease being a later linked transaction. 
 In all cases the grant of the notional lease and the grant of the actual lease are treated as linked transactions. Where there is a change in the tenant between the effective dates for the notional lease and the actual lease the tenant under the actual lease is liable for any LTT or additional LTT, due in respect of the notional lease as a result of the linked transaction, and the tenant under the actual lease is to be treated as the buyer under the notional lease for these purposes. 
 Where an agreement for lease is entered into and substantially performed, but within 12 months of the date of the substantial performance of the agreement it is rescinded or annulled, and the relevant return is amended by the taxpayer, the WRA will repay the tax. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd enters into an agreement for lease with B Ltd. The land is non-residential and the agreement for lease is for a term of 5 years from the date that the lease is actually granted (which is not yet known). The rent is £250,000 per year. The agreement for lease is made on 1 March 2020 and A Ltd pays its first quarter’s rent on that date, in accordance with the agreement at a rate of £250,000 per year. The agreement for lease is therefore substantially performed on that date. 
 In the agreement for lease, this payment may be expressed as a licence fee payable for occupation during the period prior to the actual lease completion date. For LTT purposes, this is treated as rent payable under a notional lease. 
 As the date that the lease will end is unknown at the point of substantial performance (as it depends on when the lease is actually granted), the notional lease should be treated as indefinite until the actual lease is granted. A lease for an indefinite period is to be treated, when first granted, as a lease for a fixed term of one year (see  LTTA/4030(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6039)(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6039) ). In this example, the net present value of the rent of this one-year lease is £241,545, so is above the non-residential 0% threshold of £225,000. 
 The taxpayer must submit a return by 31 March 2020 in relation to that notional lease assuming as it is a notifiable transaction. 
 When the actual lease is granted, a further return will be required for the return made in relation to the notional lease (see  LTTA/6020(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5532) ). For example, B Ltd grants the actual lease on 1 October 2021. The further return will need to be made by 31 October 2021 self-assessing the tax due on the longer notional lease, being 6.5 years (made up of the period the agreement for lease was operating 1 March 2020 to 30 September 2021 and the period of the lease 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2026. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 C Ltd enters into an agreement for lease with D Ltd. The land is non-residential and the agreement is for a lease term from and including the date of grant of the lease until 31 March 2030. The rent is £100,000 per year. The tenant substantially performs the agreement by taking possession of the premises on 1 March 2020 and C Ltd pays its first quarter’s rent on that date, in accordance with the agreement at a rate of £100,000 per year. 
 In the agreement for lease, this payment may be expressed as a licence fee payable for occupation during the period prior to the actual lease completion date. For LTT purposes, this is treated as rent payable under a notional lease. 
 As there is a definite end date to the lease at the point of substantial performance, the notional lease is for a fixed term of 10 years and 1 month (from and including 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2030). 
 As this lease is for a term of seven years or more and is granted for chargeable consideration, the transaction is notifiable. WRA must therefore be notified within 30 days of the effective date of substantial performance (in this case 1 March 2020).

The rent is £100,000 per year. The tenant substantially performs the agreement by taking possession of the premises on 1 March 2020 and C Ltd pays its first quarter’s rent on that date, in accordance with the agreement at a rate of £100,000 per year. 
 In the agreement for lease, this payment may be expressed as a licence fee payable for occupation during the period prior to the actual lease completion date. For LTT purposes, this is treated as rent payable under a notional lease. 
 As there is a definite end date to the lease at the point of substantial performance, the notional lease is for a fixed term of 10 years and 1 month (from and including 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2030). 
 As this lease is for a term of seven years or more and is granted for chargeable consideration, the transaction is notifiable. WRA must therefore be notified within 30 days of the effective date of substantial performance (in this case 1 March 2020).

 Assignment of agreement for lease 
 (Paragraph 21) 
 If an agreement for lease, or an interest in an agreement for lease, is assigned from one person to another the pre-completion rules in schedule 2 do not apply. 
 Instead, if the agreement has not been substantially performed, the rules relating to contract and transfer apply as though the agreement was with the assignee and not the original person with whom the original agreement for lease was made, and that the consideration given by the assignee for the agreement included any consideration given by them for the assignment. 
 If the agreement has been substantially performed, then the assignment is a separate land transaction and the date of the assignment is the effective date of the transaction. 
 Cases where assignment of lease treated as a grant of a lease 
 (paragraph 22) 
 In most cases the assignment of a lease will result in LTT being payable on any consideration given other than rent, for example a premium, but not on the rent payable under the lease. This is because those rents have already been taxed when the lease was first granted. Any tax that becomes due in the future, for example where the lease is extended, must be taxed. 
 If, when the lease was granted, the buyer claimed a relief under: 
 
 sale and leaseback relief 
 alternative finance investment bond relief 
 group relief 
 reconstruction and acquisitions relief 
 charities relief, or  
 relief applying to certain acquisitions involving public bodies 
 
 the first assignment of the lease that is not subject to a claim to relief listed above (or is not acquired as bare trustee of the assignor) is treated as though it were the grant of a lease. 
 The term of the lease deemed to have been granted is for a term equal to the unexpired term of the lease when assigned to a person not claiming one of the reliefs, and is deemed to be granted on the same terms as first granted. 
 The deemed grant of lease rules do not apply if the withdrawal of relief rules, as a result of a relevant disqualifying event, are triggered and applied to the original grant of the lease transaction, or such subsequent transaction for which a claim to relief was made. 
 Assignment of lease 
 (paragraph 23) 
 Where a lease is assigned any LTT obligations that would have fallen on the seller on or before the effective date of the transaction become the obligations of the buyer after that date. 
 The obligations that may become the buyers are: 
 
 the duty to make a return where a contingency is ascertained 
 the duty to make a return or further return in consequence of later linked transactions 
 the duty to make a return or further return where a fixed term or indefinite term lease continues 
 the duty to make a return or further return where an underpayment of tax arises when rent is determined on a reconsideration date 
 
 Additionally, the buyer will be entitled to make a claim where an overpayment of tax arises as a result of rent being determined on a reconsideration date. 
 Reduction of rent or term or other variation of the lease 
 (paragraph 24) 
 Where a lease is varied so that the rent payable is reduced, that variation to the lease is treated as an acquisition of a chargeable interest by the tenant and any consideration given in money or money’s worth is chargeable to LTT. 
 In relation to any other variation, any consideration in money or money’s worth (other than an increase in rent) given by the tenant for the variation is an acquisition of a chargeable interest by the tenant and chargeable to LTT. 
 A variation to a lease that reduces the term of the lease is treated as the acquisition of a chargeable interest by the landlord. In the event that the landlord pays the tenant money or money’s worth for the agreement to the reduction in the term that amount will be liable to LTT and a return must be made to the WRA if it is a notifiable transaction. 
 Increase of rent treated as grant of new lease: variation in the first 5 years 
 (paragraph 25) 
 Where a lease is varied so that the amount of rent is increased from a date before the end of the fifth year of the term of the lease, the variation is treated as the grant of a lease made in consideration of the additional rent payable. However, this rule does not apply where the variation was as a result of a provision contained in the lease before the variation was made, or of variations arising in relation to certain agricultural leases.

354,354,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Leases,LTTA/4110 Calculation of relevant rent," The relevant rent threshold changed in February 2021. 
 For any transaction completed: 
 
 before 4 February 2021 the relevant rent threshold is £9,000 
 on or after 4 February 2021 the relevant rent threshold is £13,500 
 
 The relevant rent is the highest annual rent over the entire term of the lease. Where, at the effective date of the transaction, the rent is not ascertainable for the entire term of the lease, the relevant rent is the highest ascertainable annual rent payable. Where the lease specifies rent for periods other than annual periods, the relevant rent will be the highest ascertainable rent for any such period, averaged into an annual figure. Where rent is uncertain, but can be determined using a reasonable estimate, then it should be ascertained using such an estimate. The exception to this rule is that, where the rent is only expected to increase in line with an index designed to express inflation, the uncertainty can be ignored and the relevant rent based on known certain rent. Where the rent is uncertain because additional rent would be due if a specified contingency were to take place, then the rent is to be ascertained on the basis that the contingency will occur. 
 Where there are a number of leases in a linked transaction, the relevant rent should be calculated separately for each of them then added together.  
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Company A enters into a 5-year lease agreement. The rent is set at a constant £7,000 per annum. The relevant rent is £7,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 Company B enters into a 10-year lease agreement. The rent is set at a constant £8,900 per annum. There is a rent review at the end of the fifth year. The relevant rent is the highest ascertainable (at the effective date of the transaction) amount of rent payable; namely £8,900. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Company C enters into a 10-year lease agreement. The rent is set at a constant £7,000 per annum for the first 5 years, increasing to £9,500 per annum thereafter. The relevant rent is the highest ascertainable (at the effective date of the transaction) annual rent; namely £9,500. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 Company D enters into a 15-year lease agreement. On the effective date of the transaction the rent value is only ascertainable in respect of the first year. The rent for the first month is set at £400, increasing by £50 per month until the end of the first year of the term of the lease (£450 for the second month, £500 for the third until the 12th month, which is set at £950). The highest ascertainable amount of rent payable for any period during the term of the lease, is £950 per month (for the 12th month). The relevant rent is an annualised figure based on the highest ascertainable (at the effective date of the transaction) amount of rent payable, and will therefore be £950 X 12 = £11,400. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 5 
 
 
   
 Company E enters into a 5-year lease agreement. The rent is set at £12,000 for the first 18 months and £15,000 for the second 18-month period. Rent beyond the first 3-year period is not ascertainable at the effective date of the transaction. The relevant rent is an annualised figure based on the highest ascertainable (at the effective date of the transaction) amount of rent payable, and will therefore be £15,000 /18 X 12 = £10,000. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 6 
 
 
   
 Company F enters into a 12-year lease agreement. The rent is set at a constant £8,000 per annum. However, the lease provides that the rent will increase to £9,500 if the Bank of England increases the rate of interest to above 3% at any time during the term of the lease. The relevant rent is calculated on the basis that the contingency will take place. The relevant rent is therefore £9,500.

 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
356,356,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5250 Trusts," (section 42 and Schedule 8) 
 Specific rules set out the responsibilities of trustees and how LTT applies in relation to interests in trusts and to the acquisition of a chargeable interest through the exercise of a power of appointment or a discretion. 
 The responsibilities of the trustee and beneficiaries in LTT depend on the kind of trust in which the land is held. 
 There are 2 basic types for the purposes of LTT: 
 
 bare trusts which include nominee arrangement 
 settlement trusts 
 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
357,357,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5260 Bare trusts," (paragraph 3) 
 A bare trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or simple trust in Scotland, is one in which each beneficiary is absolutely entitled as against the trustees to the property comprised in the trust. 
 ‘Absolutely entitled’ broadly means that: 
 
 the beneficiary may acquire or receive the trust property either immediately or by giving the requisite notice to the trustees in accordance with the terms of the trust 
 the trustees have no power over or right to deal with the trust property without the permission of the beneficiary who enjoys absolute entitlement 
 
 Where: 
 
 the trustees are required to meet certain out goings or expenses of the trust 
 and refuse to make trust property available to the beneficiary until such out goings or expenses have been met 
 
 the determination of whether the beneficiary is absolutely entitled to the trust property as against the trustees is not affected. 
 Two or more people may be absolutely entitled as against the trustees to trust property, provided that each of them has the rights to the trust property described above. 
 Where a person acquires a chargeable interest as bare trustee, LTT applies as if the interest was vested in, and the acts of the trustee in relation to it, were the acts of the person or persons for whom they are trustee. 
 Accordingly, if a bare trustee or nominee acquires property on behalf of the beneficiary, that will be treated as an acquisition by the beneficiary. The beneficiary is the person who has responsibility for submitting the return and is also the person responsible for paying the LTT. The return should therefore be made in the name of the beneficiary and not the trustee. 
 More guidance on the meaning of absolutely entitled can be found in the  HMRC Capital Gains Manual at CG34320-34352(https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg34320) . 
 Bare Trusts: leases 
 Unlike the position set out above, where a lease is granted to a person as bare trustee, that person, rather than the beneficiary, is treated as the buyer of the lease. Similarly, where the lease is granted by a person as bare trustee, that person, rather than the beneficiary, is treated as the seller/grantor of the lease. 
 Accordingly, the bare trustee is responsible for submitting any returns and paying any tax. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
358,358,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5270 Settlements," A settlement for LTT is any trust arrangement other than a bare trust. There are many types of trust arrangement. 
 Common examples are: 
 Interest in possession trusts 
 This type of trust exists when a beneficiary, known as an income beneficiary, has a right to the income of the trust as it arises. The trustees must pass all of the income received, less any trustees’ expenses and tax, to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries, as the case may be). 
 A beneficiary who is entitled to the income of the trust for life is known as a life tenant under a trust established in England, Wales or Northern Ireland or a life-renter under a trust established in Scotland. 
 The income beneficiary often does not have any rights over the capital of this kind of trust. Normally the capital will pass to a different beneficiary or beneficiaries at a specific time in the future or following a specific future event. 
 Discretionary trusts 
 Trustees of a discretionary trust generally have discretion about how to use the capital and income of the trust. They may be required to use any income for the benefit of particular beneficiaries but they can decide how much is paid and to which beneficiaries. 
 The beneficiary of a discretionary trust has no right over or interest in the capital or income of the trust. 
 Other trusts 
 There are other kinds of trust that are not bare trusts and so will be regarded as settlements for the purposes of LTT. These include accumulation and maintenance trusts, mixed trusts which are mixtures of more than one type of trust, and trusts set up under the laws of foreign jurisdictions.

359,359,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5280 Settlement trusts: acquisition by trustees," (paragraph 4) 
 When the trustees of a settlement acquire land or an interest in a partnership, the trustees will be regarded as the purchasers for LTT, therefore all the rules regarding notification and payment relate to the responsible trustees. It is the trustees rather than the beneficiaries who are responsible for completing the return and paying any tax due. 
 The trustees of the settlement are also treated as owning the whole of the chargeable interest at the point of transferring the property out of the trust. The deemed buyer of an interest is therefore also deemed to be the seller, if and when disposing of the same interest. 
 There are specific provisions for the purposes of the application of the higher rate residential property transaction rules to an acquisition of an interest in a dwelling by the trustees of a settlement.

360,360,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5290 Settlement trusts: responsibilities of trustees," (paragraph 7) 
 Where a settlement trust is liable to pay tax, interest or penalties, the amount owing can be collected from anyone of the responsible trustees. 
 However, no penalty or interest on such a penalty will be recovered from a person who did not become a ‘responsible trustee’ until after the ‘relevant time’. 
 The ‘responsible trustees’ in relation to a land transaction are the persons who are trustees at the effective date of the transaction and any person who subsequently becomes a trustee. 
 The ‘relevant time’ is: 
 
 in relation to a penalty that arises on a particular day (for example a late filing penalty) or interest on that penalty, the beginning of that day, and 
 in relation to any other penalty or interest on that penalty the time when the act or omission that caused the penalty to become payable occurred (for example in relation to a penalty relating to an error in a return the relevant time will be the date the return was filed)

361,361,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5300 Settlement trusts: relevant trustees for purposes of return," (paragraph 8) 
 A return for a land transaction can be made by any one or more of the trustees who are responsible trustees for the transaction. These are the relevant trustees. Whilst the return may be made by any one of the trustees, the declaration must be made by all of the relevant trustees.

362,362,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5310 Settlement trusts: relevant trustees for purposes of enquiries and assessments," (paragraph 9) 
 If the WRA issues a notice of enquiry concerning a return made in relation to a land transaction entered into by a settlement trust then: 
 
 the notice opening an enquiry must be issued to each of the relevant trustees whose identity is known to the WRA 
 the information powers available to the WRA are exercisable separately and where appropriate differently to each of the relevant trustees 
 any relevant trustee can request a direction for a closure notice and all relevant trustees are entitled to be parties to that application 
 any closure notice must be issued to each of the relevant trustees whose identity is known to the WRA 
 
 A determination must be made against all relevant trustees whose identity is known to WRA. The determination is not valid unless the notice is given to each of the relevant trustees whose identity is known to the WRA. 
 An assessment must be made in the names of all relevant trustees whose identity is known to the WRA. The assessment is not valid unless the notice is issued to each of the relevant trustees whose identity is known to the WRA.

363,363,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5320 Settlement trusts: relevant trustees for purposes of appeals and reviews," (paragraph 10) 
 Where an enquiry is to be settled by a settlement agreement all of the relevant trustees must be a party to that agreement. 
 A notice requesting a review of an appealable decision may be made by any relevant trustee. 
 Where such a review is undertaken by the WRA following a request by some, but not all, of the relevant trustees: 
 
 the WRA must issue a notice of the review to each of the other relevant trustees that were not a party to the request 
 any of the relevant trustees who were not a party to the request may be a party to the review if they so notify the WRA of that desire in writing 
 the notice of the WRA’s conclusions of the review must be issued to every relevant trustee whose identity is known to the WRA 
 the effect of the conclusion of the review applies to all relevant trustees 
 
 In relation to an appeal: 
 
 the appeal may be brought by any of the relevant trustees 
 a notice of appeal must be issued to each of the relevant trustees who did not make the appeal and whose identity is known to the WRA 
 any relevant trustee is entitled to be a party to the appeal 
 the tribunals determination is binding on all relevant trustees

364,364,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5330 Interests of beneficiaries under certain trusts," (paragraph 11) 
 Where a property is held in trust under Scottish law or the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, on terms which under the laws of England, Wales and Northern Ireland would give a beneficiary an equitable interest in the trust property, then any beneficiary is to be treated as having such an interest, even if no such interest is recognised by the law of Scotland or such other country. 
 Additionally, an acquisition of the interest of a beneficiary under the trust will also be treated as involving the acquisition of an interest in the trust property. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
365,365,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5340 Changes to the trustees of a continuing settlement," Trustees of a settlement are treated as a single and continuing body of persons. 
 It follows that for a continuing settlement, a change in the composition of trustees is not a land transaction. This means in particular that there is no charge on such an occasion where trust property is secured by a mortgage or other borrowing. 
 Since there is no land transaction for LTT purposes on a change in the composition of trustees of a continuing trust, a land transaction return should not be completed. 
 Where such a change results in an application to HM Land Registry, a covering letter should accompany the application unless it is obvious from the documents that they relate to such a change. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
366,366,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5350 Consideration for exercise of power of appointment or discretion," (paragraph 5) 
 Where a chargeable interest is acquired by virtue of: 
 
 the exercise of a power of appointment 
 the exercise of a discretion vested in trustees of a settlement 
 
 any consideration given by the person in whose favour the power or discretion is exercised, is treated as consideration for the acquisition. 
 These rules will ensure that LTT will be charged in the unusual case where a person pays trustees, or someone else, in order that the power or discretion may be exercised in their favour. For example, where that person makes payment to a beneficiary so that they may benefit from the land held in the settlement trust. 
 Therefore, where consideration is provided to the trustees in exchange for the exercise of their power of appointment so that an interest in land passes out of the trust to a person, the consideration so provided is treated as consideration for the acquisition of the relevant interest in land. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
367,367,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5360 Reallocation of trust property between beneficiaries," (paragraph 6) 
 Where the trustees of a settlement allocate chargeable interests held in the trust so that: 
 
 a beneficiary acquires an interest in one trust property and ceases to have an interest in another trust property, and 
 the beneficiary consents to no longer having an interest in that trust property 
 
 the fact that the beneficiary has given consent does not represent chargeable consideration. In such cases there is therefore no land transaction. This is similar to the rules relating to the partitions. 
 However, in the event that consideration is given otherwise from one beneficiary to another to effect the reallocation, that will be chargeable consideration under the exercise of a power of discretion. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
368,368,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5370 Pension funds," Transactions involving pension funds 
 Any transaction where a pension fund is the buyer, is subject to LTT in the same way as any other transaction. There are no special rules for pension funds, as such LTT will be due where there is chargeable consideration for the transaction.  
 Therefore a pension fund that acquires a property and pays consideration, will be liable to make a return if the transaction is notifiable and to pay any tax liability arising. 
 Transfers between pension funds 
 This occurs where there is a transfer of assets and obligations from one pension fund to another, for example on the payment of a statutory cash equivalent transfer value for an individual, or on a merger of funds. 
 The transfer of land from the trustees of one pension fund to the trustees of another is the acquisition of a chargeable interest. This means it is within the scope of LTT. 
 The normal charge to tax under LTT arises on the consideration given for the land transaction. 
 There are no special rules for pension funds. LTT will only be due where there is chargeable consideration for the transaction. 
 The assumption by the transferee fund, or by the trustees of the transferee fund, of obligations to provide benefits is not chargeable consideration. 
 If other consideration is given by the transferee fund, or trustees of the transferee fund, in the form of money or money’s worth, then that will be chargeable consideration. 
 There would also be chargeable consideration if the transfer of obligations was in consideration of a defined monetary sum to be satisfied by the release of obligations by the former trustees. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-trusts-technical-guidance
369,369,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Trusts,LTTA/5380 Borrowing and mortgages," A pension fund may borrow money and may grant a mortgage or other charge over land as security. 
 For LTT purposes it is necessary to consider the borrowing and the mortgage separately in the context of a transfer described above. 
 Borrowing 
 If the transferee fund, or trustees of transferee fund: 
 
 assume an existing liability of the transferor fund or trustees of the transferor fund to repay borrowing, or 
 otherwise bring about the release of the transferor fund or trustees of the transferor fund from the debt, and 
 they do so as part and parcel of such a transfer 
 
 then the WRA will not treat paragraph 8, Schedule 4 LTTA (‘debt and consideration’) as meaning that there is chargeable consideration given for the land transaction. 
 Mortgages 
 Mortgages and other legal charges are security interests and dealings with them, including their creation and release, are specifically exempt from LTT. 
 Notification 
 A land transaction for no consideration is exempt from notification. Where there are linked transactions and one element is liable for LTT even though it is not notifiable, but other transactions are notifiable, then the WRA will expect the non-notifiable element of tax due to be added to the tax paid in the land transaction return for the notifiable element. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Pension fund A transfers all its assets to Pension fund B, these assets include land and property in Wales as well as land in England and a portfolio of stocks and shares. There is a £500,000 mortgage secured on the property in Wales and the transfer is subject to this charge plus a sum of £2.3m. The transfer of the land in Wales is a land transaction for LTT. The chargeable consideration for the LTT transaction will be a just and reasonable apportionment of the £2.3m (i.e. the amount that relates to the Welsh property) plus the £500,000 debt. The obligation to provide benefits to A’s pension holders is not chargeable consideration.

373,373,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5070 General provisions," Partnerships 
 (paragraph 3) 
 For the purposes of the LTT, a partnership means: 
 
 a partnership within the Partnership Act 1890 
 a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 
 a limited liability partnership formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, or 
 a firm or entity that is similar to any of the above, but is formed under the laws of a country or territory outside the UK

374,374,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5080 Chargeable interests treated as held by the partners," For the purposes of LTT a chargeable interest held by a partnership is treated as if it is held by or on behalf of the partners and any land transaction entered into for the purposes of a partnership is treated as if it is entered into by or on behalf of the partners and not by the partnership; therefore, the vendor or purchaser of the chargeable interest will be the partners. 
 These provisions apply for the calculation of LTT for the partnership even if the partnership is regarded as a legal person, or as a body corporate, under the law of the country or territory under which it is formed. One exception is group relief where a limited liability partnership can be treated as a body corporate for the purposes of establishing a group structure.

 If, for instance, partners B and C leave a partnership consisting of A, B and C, the partnership ceases to exist. If, at a later date, D joins A in partnership a new partnership has been created. 
 However, there would be a continuing partnership if D joined the ABC partnership under the same agreement and at the same time as B and C left as there is always more than one partner and that a partner was a member before the change and remains a member after the change.

 Where a partnership buys or sells a chargeable interest of a property and it is not subject to the special rules listed below then it is an ‘ordinary partnership transaction’: 
 
 transactions involving transfers to a partnership from a partner or certain other persons 
 transactions involving transfers from a partnership to a partner or certain other persons 
 transactions involving transfers between 2 partnerships 
 transactions involving transfers involving a partnership consisting wholly of bodies corporate 
 transactions involving transfers to or from a partnership where the chargeable consideration includes rent

 Responsibility of partners 
 (paragraph 9) 
 Anything required or authorised to be done by or in relation to the buyer under the transaction must be done by or in relation to all the responsible partners. 
 The responsible partners in relation to a transaction are those that are members of the partnership at the time of the effective date of the land transaction, and any partner who joins the partnership after the effective date of the transaction. 
 For practical reasons a partnership may be represented by a representative partner. 
 Representative partners 
 (paragraph 10) 
 A partnership can nominate a representative partner or partners to act on behalf of the responsible partners, including signing or confirming that a return is complete and correct. 
 A representative partner must be nominated by a majority of the partners and, to be effective, the nomination (and any revocation of the nomination) must be given to the WRA. 
 Joint and several liability of responsible partners 
 (paragraph 11) 
 All the responsible partners have joint and several liability for the payment of LTT (including the recovery of any LTT repaid where that repayment was excessive), any penalties arising from late filing or inaccuracies or any interest charged. 
 However, a responsible partner is not jointly and severally liable for any tax or interest arising on that tax for a transaction unless the partner was a partner on the effective date of the transaction. In relation to any penalties a responsible partner is not liable to any penalty, or any interest arising on that penalty, unless they were a partner on the day that the penalty arose, or was a partner when the act or omission giving rise to the penalty occurred. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A partnership whose members are Ms C and Mrs D (the CD partnership) buy a non-residential property that has an effective date of 1 June 2020. The purchase is from an unconnected person. On 10 July 2020 Mr E becomes a member of the partnership, the CDE partnership. The partnership is a continuing partnership as there is at least one partner who was a partner before and after the change in the membership. The partnership fails to make its return on the filing date 1 July 2020, filing it on 5 July 2020. It also fails to pay the LTT self-assessed on time and incurs a penalty of 5% of the unpaid tax on 31 July 2020. Finally, following an enquiry it is found that the tax self assessed has been understated and a penalty arises on that error as well. 
 Ms C and Mrs D are jointly and severally liable for all of the tax, penalties and interest arising. Mr E is jointly and severally liable for penalties arising as a result of the partnership failing to pay the tax on time and any interest arising on those penalties because he was a partner on 31 July 2020. He is not liable for any tax on the transaction, the penalty for the late filing of the return (he was not a partner at the point the penalty arose), or the penalty for inaccuracies (as he was not a partner at the point of time that the act or omission giving rise to the penalties occurred) or any late payment interest on those amounts.

379,379,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5130 Definitions," Partnership property 
 (paragraph 45(1)) 
 A partnership property is an interest or right 
 
 held by or on behalf of a partnership, or by the members of a partnership,  
 for the purposes of the partnership business 
 
 These 2 tests must both be satisfied in order for a chargeable interest to be partnership property. Each is a question of fact. Often there will be an agreement between the partners which will put the position beyond doubt. 
 In practice, whether a chargeable interest is partnership property or not can be decided by reference to whether it is partnership property by virtue of section 20 of the Partnership Act 1890. A chargeable interest acquired, whether by purchase or otherwise, on account of the firm or for the purposes and in the course of the partnership business, will be partnership property for LTT purposes. 
 The mere fact that a business is carried on in a property belonging to one or more partners does not make that partner’s chargeable interest partnership property. Where a chargeable interest is owned by all the partners whether it is partnership property depends on the basis on which it is held by the co-owners. 
 It is unlikely that a chargeable interest in which the equitable interests were subject to an express declaration of joint tenancy on acquisition constitutes partnership property unless there is clear evidence of a change of intention by the joint owners to bring the chargeable interest in as an asset of the partnership business. 
 Partnership share 
 (paragraph 45(2)) 
 Any reference to a person’s partnership share at any time is to the proportion in which the person is entitled at that time to share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 Transfer of a chargeable interest 
 (paragraph 46) 
 A transfer of a chargeable interest includes: 
 
 the creation of a chargeable interest 
 the variation of a chargeable interest, and 
 the surrender or release of a chargeable interest 
 
 Transfer of chargeable interest to a partnership 
 (paragraph 47) 
 A transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership is any transfer where the chargeable interest becomes partnership property.  
 As noted above (‘transfer of a chargeable interest’), property can become partnership property without having to be transferred to a partnership. 
 Transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership 
 (paragraph 49) 
 A transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership is any transfer where: 
 
 a chargeable interest that was partnership property ceases to be partnership property, or 
 a chargeable interest is granted or created out of partnership property and that interest is not partnership property 
 
 As noted above (‘transfer of a chargeable interest’), property can cease to be partnership property without having to be transferred out of a partnership. 
 Transfer of an interest in a partnership 
 (paragraph 48) 
 Where a person acquires a partnership share or a person’s partnership share increases there is a transfer of an interest in the partnership (to that partner and from the other partners). 
 Market value leases 
 (paragraph 50) 
 The market value of a lease on grant is to be determined for the following situations: 
 
 transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership, or  
 transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership 
 
 In determining the market value of the lease, an obligation of the tenant under the lease is to be taken into account if (but only if) it is an obligation that would not normally count as chargeable consideration, or it is an obligation to make a payment to a person.  
 Connected persons 
 (paragraph 51) 
 In relation to partnership transactions, connected persons has the same meaning as it has for section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, with the exception that subsection 7 (partners connected with each other) is omitted. 
 Furthermore, in relation to identifying the relevant owner and the corresponding partner for transfers to a partnership and transfers from a partnership section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 applies with the omission of subsection (6)(c) to (e) (rules related to a trustee connected with a settlement trust).

380,380,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5140 Transactions involving transfers to a partnership," Transfer of chargeable interest to a partnership: general 
 (paragraph 13) 
 The rules set out in this section apply where a chargeable interest is transferred to a partnership by: 
 
 a partner 
 a person who will become a partner as a result of or in return for that transfer, or 
 a person connected to either the partner or person who will become a partner 
 
 The rules apply whether the transfer is in connection with the formation of a partnership or is a transfer to an existing partnership. 
 As the transfer to the partnership is by a person who is (or is to become) a partner, or a person connected to the partner, the consideration given for the land transaction is based on the market value of the subject matter of the transfer. 
 As the partner who is transferring the chargeable interest in the property to the partnership already effectively owns the subject matter of the transfer the rules operate so that only that share of the chargeable interest in the property which is subject to a change in effective economic ownerships is treated as chargeable consideration. 
 The rules are also subject to any election made by a property-investment partnership to disapply these rules. 
 A formula is used to determine the chargeable consideration in a land transfer involving the transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership.  
 The formula for calculating the chargeable consideration is: 
 MV x (100–SLP)% 
 MV is the market value  
SLP is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 The sum of lower proportions is to reflect the interest in the subject matter that was owned before and after the transfer by the transferor, and is expressed as a percentage of the ownership retained or treated as retained by the transferor. As per the definitions for the Schedule, the partnership share is based on the proportion in which the person is entitled at that time to share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 To take a simple example, if one partner transfers a chargeable interest that they have 100% ownership over into a partnership of four partners who each have an equal share in the income profits of the partnership, the partnership will only pay LTT on the 75% to reflect the transferor partner’s 25% interest. This is because the transferor partner effectively owned that share of the chargeable interest in the property before and after the transaction, whereas the three other partners now have an interest of 25% each in the chargeable interest in the property when before the transaction they held no interest in it. 
 Sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP’) 
 (paragraph 14) 
 There is a 5 step process to determine the sum of lower proportions (‘SLP’): 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners.  
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner identify the corresponding partner or corresponding partners. If there is no corresponding partner the sum of the lower proportions is zero. 
 Step 3 – for each relevant owner establish the proportion, based on the share of the income profits of the partnership, of the chargeable interest in the property, to which each relevant owner was entitled immediately before the transaction. Then apportion that proportion between any one or more of that relevant owner’s corresponding partners. 
 Step 4 - for each corresponding partner find the lower proportion of either: 
 
 the proportion of the interest attributable to the partner, or 
 the partner’s partnership share immediately after the transaction 
 
 Step 5 - add together the lower proportions in step 4 for each corresponding partner.  
 The result is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Relevant owner 
 (paragraph 15) 
 A person is a relevant owner (step1 of the SLP calculation) if: 
 
 immediately before the transaction, they were entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest, and 
 immediately after the transaction they are a partner in the partnership or connected to a partner. 
 
 For the purposes of determining the sum of lower proportions, any person who is a joint tenant is treated as a tenant in common with each tenant holding equal undivided shares in the property.  
 Corresponding partner 
 (paragraph 16) 
 A person is a corresponding partner (step 2 of the SLP calculation) in relation to a relevant owner if, immediately after the land transaction, the person: 
 
 is a partner, and 
 is the relevant owner or is an individual connected with the relevant owner 
 
 Proportion of chargeable interest attributable to corresponding partner 
 (paragraph 17) 
 The proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to a corresponding partner (step 4 of the SLP calculation) is: 
 
 if the partner is a corresponding partner only in relation to one relevant owner, the proportion (if any) of the chargeable interest is that apportioned to that partner (under step 3 above) in respect of that owner,  
 if the partner is a corresponding partner in relation to more than one relevant owner the proportion is the sum of the proportions (if any) of the chargeable interest apportioned to that partner (under step 3 above) in respect of each of those owners 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to cover many of the aspects in establishing the chargeable consideration where a chargeable interest is transferred to a partnership and the transferor is, or will become, a partner (or is a person connected to such a person). It is set out using the 5 steps of the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP’). 
 Transaction 
 Mr and Mrs A own the freehold of a retail shop as joint tenants. The shop is to be transferred to a partnership of 3 partners (the ABC Partnership) and has a market value at the date of transaction of £750,000. Mr A is a partner. His share in the income profits of the partnership, immediately after the transfer of the shop, is 40%. Mrs A is not a partner in the partnership. The other 2 partners (Ms B and Mr C) have shares of 30% respectively immediately after the transfer of the shop. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owners 
 Mr A is a relevant owner as he has and is treated as having a 50% interest in the shop (joint tenants are for the purposes of establishing the relevant owner treated as holding their interest as tenants in common with equal shares, he is also a partner following the transaction. 
 Mrs A is not a member of the partnership, however, she is still treated as a relevant owner as she is treated as having a 50% interest in the shop before the transaction and she is a connected person (by virtue of section 1122(5)(a) of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) to her husband, who is a partner. 
 Both Mr and Mrs A are therefore relevant owners. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner identify the corresponding partner 
 Mrs A is not a partner and therefore she is not a corresponding partner. However, her husband is a partner and a connected person. Mr A is a corresponding partner as he is a partner after the transaction and is a relevant owner. The 2 other partners are not corresponding partners, as they are neither relevant owners (they did not have an interest in the property to be transferred prior to that transfer) nor are they individuals connected with a relevant owner. 
 Mr A is the only corresponding partner. 
 Step 3 – for each relevant owner find the proportion of the chargeable interest to which they are entitled immediately before the transaction 
 As identified in step 1 both Mr and Mrs A are relevant owners. Immediately before transaction, each was entitled to 50% of the chargeable interest. Mr A’s 50% is apportioned only to himself as he is his only corresponding partner. Mrs A’s 50% share is apportioned directly to her husband, who is her only corresponding partner. Therefore 100% of the chargeable interest is apportioned to Mr A. 
 Step 4- establish the lower proportions for each corresponding partner 
 As identified in step 3 Mr A is treated as being entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest before the transaction occurs. 
 Mr A’s partnership share immediately after the transaction is 40%. 
 Therefore, the lower proportion for Mr A is 40% as this is lower than the deemed to be held in the chargeable interest before the transaction occurs. 
 Step 5 – add together the lower proportions for each of the corresponding partners 
 There is only one corresponding partner therefore there are no amounts to be added together. Mr A’s lower proportion is 40%. This is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Calculation of chargeable consideration and LTT 
 The formula to be used to establish the chargeable consideration is MV x (100-SLP)%. 
 The market value is £750,000 and the SLP is 40%. Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transfer is: 
 £750,000 x (100-40)% = £450,000 
 Using the LTT rates and bands in force at 22 December this will result in a tax liability of £10,250. All 3 partners in the ABC Partnership are responsible partners and will be jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax.

 Where there is: 
 
 a transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership, including property investment partnerships (‘the land transfer’) 
 to which the SLP rules relate, and 
 there is a subsequent transfer of an interest in the partnership (‘the partnership transfer’), and 
 that transfer of the partnership interest is made by the person who makes the land transfer in relation to the partner transferring a chargeable interest to the partnership, or of a person who is to become a partner in return for transferring a chargeable interest in return for a partnership interest, or a person so connected to a partner or person who is to become a partner, and 
 the transfer is made pursuant to arrangements which are or are part of tax avoidance arrangements that existed at the time of the transfer, and 
 other than because of these special rules, the transfer of the partnership interest in the partnership is not a chargeable transaction 
 
 When these conditions apply the transfer of the interest in the partnership (the ‘partnership transfer’) is deemed to be a land transaction and that deemed land transaction is a chargeable transaction with the partners treated as the buyers. 
 The chargeable consideration is deemed to equal the proportion of the market value, on the date of the transaction, of the interest transferred by the land transfer. That proportion is: 
 
 where the person making the transfer is not a partner immediately after the partnership transfer that person’s partnership share immediately before the transfer 
 where the person was a partner immediately after the partnership transfer the difference between the person’s share before and after the transfer 
 
 Where the conditions apply, the partnership transfer and the land transfer are deemed to be linked transactions, and taxed accordingly by the linked transactions rules. 
 For the purposes of these rules the responsible partners are those who were partners immediately before the transfer and remain so after it, and any person who becomes a partner as result of, or in connection with the transfer.

 the relevant person ceasing to be a partner 
 
 
 Where a relevant person has made a loan to a partnership, the repayment of all or some of the loan, and 
 Where a relevant person has made a loan to the partnership, a withdrawal from the partnership of money or money’s worth by the relevant person that does not represent income profit. 
 
 A ‘qualifying event’ is deemed to be a land transaction and is also therefore a chargeable transaction. The buyers under the deemed transaction are the partners. 
 The chargeable consideration for the first 3 qualifying events listed above is the value of the money or money’s worth withdrawn from the partnership. 
 The chargeable consideration for the fourth qualifying event is an amount equal to the monies repaid. 
 The chargeable consideration for the fifth qualifying event will be the value of the money or money’s worth so far as it does not exceed the amount of the loan made. 
 Furthermore, the chargeable consideration determined under these rules must not exceed the market value (at the effective date of the land transfer) of the chargeable interest transferred (reduced by any amount that was previously chargeable to tax).  
 The ‘relevant person’ is: 
 
 a partner who transfers a chargeable interest to the partnership,  
 a person who transfers a chargeable interest to a partnership in return for a share in the partnership,  
 or a person who is connected to the existing partner or new partner 
 
 Where these provisions are triggered and the same event also means that a charge under the rules relating to a transfer of an interest in a property-investment partnership are also triggered the amount of tax payable (if any) in respect of the qualifying event is to be reduced (but not below nil), where applicable, by the amount of tax payable resulting from the transfer of an interest in a property-investment partnership. 
 “Tax avoidance arrangements” has the meaning given by section 31 LTTA.

383,383,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5170 Transactions involving transfers from a partnership," Transfer of chargeable interest from a partnership: general 
 (paragraph 21) 
 Where a chargeable interest is transferred from a partnership to: 
 
 a person who is or has been one of the partners, or  
 a person connected with such a person  
 
 the rules in this part apply. 
 As the transfer from the partnership is by a person who is (or is to cease to be) a partner, or a person connected to the person the consideration given for the land transaction is based on the market value of the subject matter of the transfer. The rule for calculating chargeable consideration under the partnership rules overrides the deemed market value rule, where the buyer is a company connected to the seller, etc. 
 As the person to whom the property is being transferred to already effectively owns an interest in the subject matter of the transfer through their partnership interest, the rules operate so that only the share of the property which is subject to a change in effective economic ownership is treated as chargeable consideration. 
 These provisions are also subject to the rules in Paragraph 29, that apply to the transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership to a partnership, and Paragraph 30, that apply to a partnership where all the partners are bodies corporate. 
 The rules are also subject to any election made by a property-investment partnership to disapply these rules. 
 A formula is used to determine the chargeable consideration in a land transfer involving the transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership. 
 The formula for calculating the chargeable consideration is: 
 MV x (100–SLP)% 
 MV is the market value 
SLP is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 The sum of lower proportions is to reflect the interest in the subject matter that was owned before and after the transfer by the transferee, and is expressed as a percentage of the subject matter owned before the transfer by the transferee. As per the definitions for the Schedule, the partnership share is based on the proportion in which the person is entitled at that time to share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 To take a simple example, if a partnership transfers a chargeable interest that is owned entirely by the partnership of four partners who each have an equal share in the partnership, to one of the partners, that partner will only pay LTT on the 75% to reflect the fact that the partner transferee held a 25% interest through their interest in the partnership. The transferee effectively owned that share before and after the transaction, whereas the 3 other partners now have transferred an interest of 25% each as the property is no longer owned by the partnership. 
 In the event that the partnership is dissolved or otherwise ceases to exist, the partnership is treated, for LTT purposes, as continuing until the property is distributed. 
 Sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP’) 
 (paragraph 22) 
 There is a 5 step process to determine the sum of lower proportions (‘SLP’): 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner identify the corresponding partner or partners. If there is no corresponding partner the sum of the lower proportions is zero. 
 Step 3 – for each relevant owner establish the proportion of the chargeable interest to which each owner was entitled immediately after the transaction. Then apportion that proportion between any one or more of that relevant owner’s corresponding partners. 
 Step 4 - for each corresponding partner find the lower proportion of either: 
 
 the proportion of the interest attributable to the partner, or 
 the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 
 Step 5 - add together the lower proportions in step 4 for each corresponding partner.  
 The result is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Relevant owner 
 (paragraph 23) 
 A person is a relevant owner (step1 of the SLP calculation) if: 
 
 immediately after the transaction, they were entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest, and 
 immediately before the transaction they are a partner in the partnership or connected to a partner. 
 
 For the purposes of determining the sum of lower proportions, any person who is a joint tenant is treated as a tenant in common with each tenant holding equal undivided shares in the property. 
 Corresponding partner 
 (paragraph 24) 
 A person is a corresponding partner (step 2 of the SLP calculation) in relation to a relevant owner if, immediately before the land transaction, the person: 
 
 was a partner, and 
 was the relevant owner or is an individual connected with the relevant owner 
 
 Therefore, if the person is not the relevant owner and is a body corporate, or is otherwise not an individual, they are not a corresponding partner. 
 However, if that person is a company and it holds the property as a trustee and it is connected with the relevant owner only because of section 1122(6) of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 that company may be treated as an individual for these purposes and therefore can be a corresponding partner. 
 Proportion of chargeable interest attributable to corresponding partner 
 (paragraph 25) 
 The proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to a corresponding partner (step 4 of the SLP calculation) is: 
 
 if the partner is a corresponding partner only in relation to one relevant owner, the proportion (if any) of the chargeable interest is that apportioned to that partner (under step 3 above) in respect of that owner 
 if the partner is a corresponding partner in relation to more than one relevant owner the proportion is the sum of the proportions (if any) of the chargeable interest apportioned to that partner (under step 3 above) in respect of each of those owners 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to cover many of the aspects in establishing the chargeable consideration that arise where a chargeable interest is transferred from a partnership to a partner or a person who is to cease being a partner (or is a person connected to such a person). It is set out using the 5 steps of the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Transaction 
 The DEF Partnership owns a number of retail properties used in its retail business. These properties were originally transferred into the partnership after 20 October 2003, and SDLT was paid on the original transfer. The DEF partners are Mr D, Ms E and Ms F. Each partner’s share in the income profits of the partnership is 33.33’% in the partnership immediately before the transaction. The partners agree that one shop is to be transferred from the partnership to Ms F’s civil partner Ms G (who is not a partner in the partnership). As Ms G is in a civil partnership (note that a civil partnership or marriage is not a ‘partnership’ for the purposes of this Schedule) with Ms F, she is a connected person to that partner in the DEF Partnership. The property has a market value at the date of transaction of £900,000. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owners 
 Ms G is a relevant owner as she will have 100% interest in the shop following the transfer from the partnership. Whilst Ms G is not a partner in the partnership before the transfer she is in a civil partnership with Ms F so she is a connected person to that partner in the DEF Partnership. Despite Ms F and Ms G’s civil partnership Ms F is not a relevant owner as she is not entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest following the transfer from the DEF Partnership. 
 Ms G is the only relevant owner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner identify the corresponding partner 
 Ms G is not a partner and therefore she is not a corresponding partner. However, her civil partner is a partner in the DEF Partnership and Ms G is therefore a connected person to a partner. Ms F is a corresponding partner as she is a partner before the transaction and is an individual connected with the relevant owner (Ms G). The 2 other partners are not corresponding partners, as they are neither relevant owners (they do not have an interest in the property after it has been transferred) nor are they individuals connected with a relevant owner. 
 Ms F is the only corresponding partner. 
 Step 3 – for each relevant owner find the proportion of the chargeable interest to which they are entitled immediately after the transaction 
 As identified in step 1 Ms G is the only relevant owner. Immediately after the transaction, she is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest. Ms G’s 100% share is apportioned directly to her civil partner, who is her only corresponding partner. Therefore 100% of the chargeable interest is apportioned to Ms F. 
 Step 4 - establish the lower proportions for each corresponding partner 
 As identified in step 3 Ms F is treated as being entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest after the transaction occurs. 
 Ms F’s partnership share immediately before the transaction is 33.33’%.  
 Therefore, the lower proportion for Ms F is 33.33’%. 
 Step 5 – add together the lower proportions for each of the corresponding partners 
 There is only one corresponding partner therefore there is no amounts to be added together. Ms F’s lower proportion is 33.33’%. This is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Calculation of chargeable consideration and LTT 
 The formula to be used to establish the chargeable consideration is MV x (100-SLP)%. 
 The market value is £900,000 and the SLP is 33.33%. Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transfer is: 
 £900,000 x (100-33.33)% = £600,000 
 Using the LTT rates and bands in force at 22 December 2020 this will result in a tax liability of £17,750. Ms G will need to send in a return for the transaction as buyer and will also be liable for payment of the tax.

 In order to establish the lower proportion under step 4 of the sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP‘) calculation of the relevant chargeable interest that was transferred to the partnership in a transaction that occurred before 20 October 2003, these special rules must be used. A relevant chargeable interest that became partnership property before 20 October 2003 will be a chargeable interest that was subject to the stamp duty rules (note that Stamp Duty is not the same as SDLT). 
 In relation to such a chargeable interest the partnership share attributable to a corresponding partner is established using the following 3 steps. 
 Step 1 – establish the partner’s share on relevant date  
 The relevant date is: 
 
 if the partner was a partner on 19 October 2003 their partnership share on that date  
 if the partner became a partner after that date their partnership share on that date 
 
 The partnership share is the partner’s share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 Step 2 – add any subsequent increases to the partner’s partnership share 
 Add any increases to the partner’s partnership share which occurred: 
 
 in the period beginning with the day after the relevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which the SLP calculation relates, and  
 the increase in the partnership share was effected by an instrument stamped with ad valorem stamp duty 
 
 Step 3 - deduct any subsequent decreases to the partner’s partnership share 
 Deduct any decreases to the partner’s partnership share which occurred in the period beginning with the day after the relevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which the SLP calculation relates. 
 The result of these 3 steps is the partnership share attributable to the partner.  
 If the partner ceased to be a partner before 19 October 2003 the partnership share attributable to that partner is zero. 
 A relevant chargeable interest is: 
 
 the chargeable interest that ceases to be partnership property and to which the SLP calculation is being carried out; or 
 where the transaction to which the SLP calculation is being carried out is the creation of a chargeable interest, the chargeable interest out of which the interest is created

 A relevant chargeable interest is: 
 
 the chargeable interest that ceases to be partnership property and to which the SLP calculation is being carried out, or 
 where the transaction to which the SLP calculation is being carried out is the creation of a chargeable interest, the chargeable interest out of which the interest is created 
 
 If this paragraph applies and neither of the following two conditions apply the partnership share attributable will be zero. The relevant conditions are: 
 
 the instrument by which the transfer was effected was stamped with ad valorem stamp duty, or 
 any LTT, or where relevant stamp duty land tax, payable in respect to the transfer has been paid.  
 
 In relation to such a chargeable interest, and where one of the conditions concerning payment of stamp duty etc. apply, the partnership share attributable to a corresponding partner is established using the following 3 steps. 
 Step 1 – establish the partner’s share on relevant date 
 The relevant date is: 
 
 if the partner was a partner on the effective date of the transfer of the relevant chargeable interest to the partnership, that date 
 if the partner became a partner after that date their partnership share on that date 
 
 The partnership share is the partner’s share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 Step 2 – add any subsequent increases to the partner’s partnership share 
 Add any increases to the partner’s partnership share which occurred: 
 
 in the period beginning with the day after the relevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which the SLP calculation relates, and  
 if the increase took place on or before 22 July 2004, the increase in the partnership share was effected by an instrument stamped with ad valorem stamp duty, or 
 if the increase occurred after 22 July 2004, any LTT, or where relevant stamp duty land tax, in relation to the increase in the partnership share has been paid 
 
 Part 3 of Schedule 15 Finance Act 2003 was replaced by Schedule 41 Finance Act 2004 from 23 July 2004. 
 Step 3 - deduct any subsequent decreases to the partner’s partnership share 
 Deduct any decreases to the partner’s partnership share which occurred in the period beginning with the day after the relevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which the SLP calculation relates. 
 The result of these 3 steps is the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 If the partner ceased to be a partner before the effective date of the transfer of the relevant chargeable interest to the partnership, the partnership share attributable to that partner is zero.

386,386,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5200 Other partnership transactions," Transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership to a partnership 
 (paragraph 29) 
 Where there is a transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership to another partnership and the transfer is one to which both the rules relating to the sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP’) for a transfer to a partnership and the transfer from a partnership would, except for this section apply, then the following rules ensure that both sets of rules do not apply together.  
 The taxpayer must calculate the chargeable consideration under both the transfer to a partnership and the transfer from a partnership rules and then calculate the tax on the higher of the 2 chargeable consideration amounts. If there are no partners in common between the 2 partnerships the SLP will be zero and the transaction will be an ‘ordinary partnership transaction’. 
 If the whole or part of the consideration given is rent then, for a partnership to partnership transfer where there are partners in common, the rules relating to partnership transactions and leases do not apply solely as set out in those rules. 
 Instead, the tax chargeable in respect of the consideration that consists of rent is the greater of: 
 
 what the tax chargeable would be if the rules relating to partnership transactions and leases applied in relation to a transaction which the transfer to a partnership rules apply to, and 
 what the tax chargeable would be if the rules relating to partnership transactions and leases applied in relation to a transaction which the transfer from a partnership rules apply to 
 
 The relevant rent lease rules that provide for the zero rate band for the ‘consideration other than rent’ to be disapplied where the consideration that consists of rent is greater than the relevant amount also applies in relation to transfers from a partnership to a partnership. 
 Transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership consisting wholly of bodies corporate 
 (paragraph 30) 
 Where there is a transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership where all the partners are bodies corporate, to one of those partners or a person connected to that partner and the sum of lower proportions is 75% or more, the chargeable consideration for the land transfer is the market value of the interest that is transferred. 
 If any of the chargeable consideration includes rent, then the chargeable consideration is the Net Present Value of the rent over the term of the lease as well as the market value of the lease. 
 It may be possible for group relief to be claimed. However, if the partners are not all part of the same group and the person to whom the interest is transferred is not in that same group, group relief cannot be claimed. 
 Leases: Transfer of a chargeable interest to or from a partnership: chargeable consideration including rent. 
 (paragraph 31) 
 Where a partnership is: 
 
 granted a lease by a partner or person who becomes a partner as a result or in connection with the grant of that lease, or  
 granting a lease to a partner, or person who has been a partner 
 
 the rules relating to a transfer to a partnership and a transfer from a partnership are modified (see  paragraph 31 of Schedule 7 LTTA(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/schedule/7) ). 
 
LTT is charged on: 
 
 a proportion of the Net Present Value (NPV) of the rent payable over the term of the lease, and 
 a proportion of any consideration other than rent and market value of the lease 
 
 The NPV of the rent over the term of the lease is determined according the normal rules applying to leases. Of this amount, the relevant chargeable proportion is determined as: 
 (100 – SLP)% 
 where ‘SLP‘ is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Where there is consideration other than rent (for example a premium) the chargeable consideration is determined in the same way as the acquisition of any other chargeable interest in land, that is it is equal to: 
 MV x (100-SLP)% 
 where MV is the market value and SLP is the sum of the lower proportions. 
 Where a lease is transferred or granted from a partnership, and all the partners are bodies corporate to another body corporate that is or has been a partner, and the SLP is 75% or more, then the chargeable consideration is taken to be the market value of the interest transferred and if all the relevant conditions are met, group relief may be claimed.

A partnership will still be treated as a PIP even where it is also renovating, constructing, etc. the buildings it is investing in (‘construction operations’ as defined by section 74 of the Finance Act 2004). In identifying whether a partnership is a PIP consideration is also to be given to the use to which property outside Wales is used, where that property would be a chargeable interest if it were in Wales. A PIP, for example, will not include a farming partnership, nor will it include a house builder whose only or main activity is the construction and sale of property to third parties (even where some properties may occasionally be retained and rented out because no buyer can be found) because most of its profit is generated by building houses not dealing in the land. Whether a partnership‘s only or main activity is investing or dealing in chargeable interests will be a question of fact. 
 Transfer of an interest in a property-investment partnership 
 (paragraph 34) 
 Where there is a transfer of an interest in a property-investment partnership (‘PIP’) and the ‘relevant partnership property‘ includes a chargeable interest, the transfer of that interest is treated as a land transaction and therefore a chargeable transaction for the purposes of this part of this schedule. The buyer in that land transaction is the person who becomes a partner, or increases their partnership share, as a result of the transaction. 
  
The chargeable consideration is not determined in accordance with any other provisions but is an amount equal to a proportion of the market value of relevant partnership property. The proportion is established in one of the 2 following ways: 
 
 if a person acquiring an interest in the partnership is not a partner prior to the transfer, their share in the partnership immediately after the transfer, or 
 if the person acquiring an interest in the partnership is a partner prior to the transfer, the difference between the partnership share before and after the transfer 
 
 The transfer of an interest in a property investment partnership is treated as a chargeable interest for the purposes of the withdrawal of group relief. 
 There are 2 different types of transfer of an interest in a property investment-partnership, a Type A transfer or a Type B transfer. 
 Type A transfer 
 A Type A transfer is a transfer where: 
 
 the whole or part of a partner’s interest is acquired by another partner, or another person, and money or money’s worth is given by the partner or person acquiring the interest, or 
 a person becomes a partner, and the interest of an existing partner is reduced (or they leave the partnership) and there is a withdrawal of money or money’s worth by the existing partner (other than of money or money’s worth that was available to the partnership prior to the transfer) 
 
 ‘Relevant partnership property‘ for a Type A transfer is all the chargeable interests held by a partnership immediately after the transfer other than: 
 
 any chargeable interest transferred to the partnership as part of the transaction; 
 market rent leases, and 
 any chargeable interest that is not attributable economically to the interest in the partnership that is being transferred 
 
 Type B transfer 
 A Type B transfer is any other transfer of a partnership interest in a PIP that is not a Type A transfer. 
 ‘Relevant partnership property‘ for a Type B transfer is all the chargeable interests held by a partnership immediately after the transfer other than:  
 
 any chargeable interest transferred to the partnership as part of the transaction 
 market rent leases 
 any chargeable interest that is not attributable economically to the interest in the partnership that is being transferred 
 any chargeable interest that was transferred to the partnership on or before 22 July 2004 
 any chargeable interest where an election to disapply the rules relating to the transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership has been made, and 
 any other chargeable interest where the transfer to the partnership was not made by a partner, someone who become a partner as a result of the transfers or by a person connected with a partner and to which the sum of the lower proportions rules were applied 
 
 Exclusion of market rent leases 
 (paragraph 35) 
 A lease held as partnership property immediately after a transfer of an interest in the partnership is not relevant partnership property for either a Type A or a Type B transfer if the following 4 conditions are met: 
 
 condition 1 is that:
	 
 no chargeable consideration other than rent has been given in respect of the grant of the lease, and 
 no arrangements are in place at the time of the transfer for any chargeable consideration other than rent to be given in respect of the grant of the lease. 
 
 
 condition 2 is that the rent payable under the lease as granted was a ‘market rent’ at the time of the grant. 
 condition 3 is that:
	 
 the term of the lease is 5 years or less, or 
 if the term of the lease is more than 5 years:
		 
 the lease provides for the rent payable under it to be reviewed at least once in every 5 years of the term, and 
 the rent payable under the lease as a result of a review is required to be a market rent at the review date. 
 
 
 
 
 condition 4 is that there has been no change to the lease since it was granted which would have the effect of making the rent payable under the lease less than a market rent 
 
 The ‘market rent’ of a lease is the rent which the lease might reasonably be expected to fetch at that time in the open market. 
 A ‘review date’ is a date from which the rent determined as a result of a rent review is payable.

388,388,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5220 Election by a property-investment partnership to disapply the rules related to the transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership," When there is a transfer of a chargeable interest to a property-investment partnership (‘PIP’), the buyer can elect for the rules in relation to transfers of a chargeable interest to a partnership to not apply. 
 Where such an election is made: 
 
 the rules in relation to transfers of a chargeable interest from a partnership, are also disapplied (and therefore paragraphs 18 & 19 also do not apply) 
 the chargeable consideration is taken to be the market value of the chargeable interest, and  
 the transaction is treated as an ordinary partnership transaction 
 
 An election under this paragraph must be included in the LTT return made in respect of the transaction or in an amendment of that return. Where the return is made online, the election must be sent at the same time as making the return to: 
 Welsh Revenue Authority(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) 
PO Box 108 
Merthyr Tydfil 
CF47 7DL (if by post) 
 or submit via a  WRA Contact Us form(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority/contact-us) . 
 The election must state the taxpayer’s name, the address of the property concerned and the reference of the return which relates to the acquisition of the property by the PIP. 
 The election is irrevocable and a return may not be amended so as to withdraw the election. 
 Conversely, it is possible for an amendment to the return to be made in which an election is made. Where an election is made in relation to a transaction (referred to as the ‘main transaction‘) in an amendment to the return: 
 
 the election has effect as if it had been made on the date on which the return was made, and 
 any return in respect of an ‘affected transaction‘ may be amended (within the period allowed for amendment of that return) to take account of that election 
 
 An ‘affected transaction’, in relation to the main transaction, means a PIP transaction with an effective date on or after the effective date of the main transaction.  
 Partnership interests: application of provisions about exchange 
 (paragraph 37) 
 Where the exchange rules apply to the acquisition of an interest in a property-investment partnership (‘PIP’) because the consideration for entering into that transaction is entering into a land transaction, the interest in the PIP is treated as though it were a major interest in land (if the relevant partnership property includes a major interest in land). This rule provides that the rules for exchanges can then operate to the exchange (as the interests exchanged must be major interests). However, the rules about the division or partition of a chargeable interest do not apply. 
 The ‘relevant partnership property’ has the same meaning as it does for a Type A or Type B transfer.

389,389,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Partnerships,LTTA/5230 Application of exemptions and reliefs," The exemption from the charge to tax where there is no chargeable consideration does not apply to: 
 
 transactions involving the transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership 
 transactions involving the transfer of a chargeable interest from a partnership 
 transfers of a partnership interests pursuant to tax avoidance arrangements, or 
 a transfer of an interest in a property investment partnership 
 
 Subject to the specific rules related to the application of group and charities relief any other provision affording exemption or relief from LTT applies to partnership transactions. 
 Application of group relief 
 (paragraph 40) 
 Group relief is available in transactions involving partnerships where the conditions for that relief are met. 
 Specific rules apply where:  
 
 the transaction is one where there is a transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership by a partner, a person who becomes a partner as a result of the transfer, or a connected person, and  
 the transaction is a chargeable transaction because it is pursuant to tax avoidance arrangements 
 
 Where this situation arises, the group relief withdrawal rules are to be read with a number of substitutions (see  para 40 of Schedule 7 LTTA(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/schedule/7) ).  
 The primary requirement of group relief is whether the companies concerned are within a group structure and this depends upon the status of the companies involved: they must be bodies corporate and, to establish a group structure, they must have issued share capital. It should be noted though that a limited liability partnership is a body corporate and can therefore be the parent of a group of companies. It cannot, however, be a subsidiary or sister company as it has no issued share capital. Furthermore, property cannot be transferred to the limited liability partnership and benefit from a claim to group relief. 
 Group relief is withdrawn where a body corporate partner who was a partner at the effective date of the acquisition, which is relieved from charge because of a claim to group relief by the partner, ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller before the end of the period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the transaction, or in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of that period. References to the ‘buyer’ in the rules for group relief are to be read as references to the relevant partner. 
 Where group relief is partially withdrawn, the amount of tax chargeable is an appropriate proportion having regard to the subject matter of the relevant transaction, and what is held at the relevant time by, or on behalf of the partnership, and to the proportion in which the relevant partner is entitled at the relevant time to share in the income profits of the partnership. 
 Sum of the lower proportions: connected companies 
 (paragraph 41) 
 When calculating the sum of the lower proportions for a transaction involving a transfer to a partnership, by a partner, a person who becomes a partner as a result of the transfer, or a connected person, and a company (a connected company) would be a corresponding partner of a relevant owner (but for the rule that it applies only to individuals) and the 2 companies are in the same group, the group relief rules are to be read with a number of substitutions (see  para 4 of Schedule 7 LTTA(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/schedule/7) ). The rule permits the tax charge, in respect of the transaction, to be reduced to the amount that would have been payable had the connected company been a corresponding partner of the original owner for the purposes of calculating the sum of the lower proportions (‘SLP’). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 The effect of these rules can be seen in the following example. A Ltd transfers a chargeable interest to a partnership consisting of Individual 1, Individual 2 and B Ltd. A Ltd and B Ltd are wholly owned by C Ltd, which is in turn owed by the father of Individual 1 and Individual 2. The transfer is therefore one to which the rules relating to a transfer of a chargeable interest to a partnership will apply as A Ltd is connected to individuals 1 and 2 and B Ltd. 
 B Ltd is not a corresponding partner of the relevant owner (A Ltd) as although it is a partner, it is not the relevant owner, nor an individual connected to the relevant owner. However, as the 2 companies are grouped (they are both 75% subsidiaries of a third company C Ltd), these special rules apply. As a result, the charge in respect of the transaction is reduced to the amount that would have been chargeable had the connected company been a corresponding partner for the purposes of calculating the SLP. 
 In the particular circumstances given above, the charge is reduced to nil because the SLP is 100%, as the connected company is treated as a corresponding partner. 
 This rule does not apply the other way around, i.e. a transfer from a partnership.

 Treatment of partnerships for group relief purposes 
 The status of a partnership for group relief purposes depends on the nature of that partnership. 
 The status of the partnership is relevant for group relief claims, despite liability to LTT otherwise falling to the partners, rather than the partnership as a separate entity. A transfer of a chargeable interest to or from a partnership means that the partnership itself is ‘looked through’ with the partners being the persons liable to LTT. 
 When looking at transfers to or from group companies where there is a partnership in the group structure, the type of partnership determines whether the provisions of group relief can apply. 
 Partnerships formed under the laws of England and Wales; E&W Partnerships and E&W Limited Partnerships have no legal personality and are therefore transparent for UK taxation purposes. 
 Scottish Partnerships and Scottish Limited Partnerships are not bodies corporate and therefore cannot be members of an LTT group, but they do have legal personality and can own shares in a subsidiary. This means a Scottish Partnership causes a break in the group structure. 
 Limited Liability Partnerships (wherever registered in the UK) are bodies corporate – they therefore can be the parent of a group as they are both bodies corporate and capable of owning the shares in the subsidiary companies. However, they also have the effect of breaking a group as the LLP does not have issued share capital. 
 Non-UK partnerships are to be treated for the purposes of LTT in the manner of the UK partnership it most closely resembles. 
 
 
 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnerships (‘EWP‘) and English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Limited Partnerships (‘EWLP‘) 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% partnership interest each in ‘The Partnership’. ‘The Partnership’ owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnership (EWP) or an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) Limited Partnership (EWLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 - for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
(C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner) 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x (100-50)% 
 Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transaction is 50% of the market value of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd (and therefore all the partners are grouped), group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge to B Ltd identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP). 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 – the sum of the lower proportions 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd, group relief will, if the conditions are met, give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by ‘The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 As an EWP/EWLP is transparent under UK taxation laws B Ltd and C Ltd each own 50% of the issued share capital of E Ltd. As both B Ltd and C Ltd are 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd this is a group for LTT purposes and if the requirements of group relief are met a claim may be made to relieve the liability arising on the market value of the property transferred. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – Scottish Partnerships (‘ScP‘) and Scottish Limited Partnerships (‘ScLP‘) 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Scottish Partnership (SP) or a Scottish Limited Partnership (ScLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner (C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner).  
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 We just have one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership, and as the transfer is from an ScP or ScLP, the partnership is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to SP/Sc LP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd, (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 The partnership, as a ScP or ScLP, is as regards chargeable interests held by the partnership, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by the partnership to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 An ScP/Sc LP has its own legal personality so it cannot be looked through to the partners to establish group relationships. For group relief to apply it is necessary to identify a group structure including the ScP/Sc LP. 
 As an ScP/ScLP is not a body corporate it does not meet the requirements of group relief (as a corporate body with issued share capital) so LTT is due on this transaction as a transfer from one company to another without the benefit of group relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – Limited Liability Partnerships 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd and ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (LLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 (C Ltd cannot be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner) 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership as an LLP is as regards chargeable interests held by the LLP, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to LLP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step 3 was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 The partnership, as a LLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner  
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by the partnership to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. 
 However, the group relief rules need also need to be considered. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 An LLP has its own legal personality so it cannot be looked through to the partners so for group relief to apply it is necessary to identify a group structure including the LLP. 
 Although it is a body corporate it does not have an issued share capital so it cannot meet the requirements for group (it cannot be a subsidiary of another company) so LTT is due on this transaction as a transfer from one company to another without the benefit of group relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnerships (‘EWP‘) and English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Limited Partnerships (‘EWLP‘) 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% partnership interest each in ‘The Partnership’. ‘The Partnership’ owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnership (EWP) or an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) Limited Partnership (EWLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 - for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
(C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner) 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x (100-50)% 
 Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transaction is 50% of the market value of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd (and therefore all the partners are grouped), group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge to B Ltd identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP). 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 – the sum of the lower proportions 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd, group relief will, if the conditions are met, give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by ‘The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 As an EWP/EWLP is transparent under UK taxation laws B Ltd and C Ltd each own 50% of the issued share capital of E Ltd. As both B Ltd and C Ltd are 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd this is a group for LTT purposes and if the requirements of group relief are met a claim may be made to relieve the liability arising on the market value of the property transferred. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% partnership interest each in ‘The Partnership’. ‘The Partnership’ owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnership (EWP) or an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) Limited Partnership (EWLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 - for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
(C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner) 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x (100-50)% 
 Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transaction is 50% of the market value of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd (and therefore all the partners are grouped), group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge to B Ltd identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP). 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules.

 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 – the sum of the lower proportions 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd, group relief will, if the conditions are met, give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by ‘The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to one of the partners).

 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 As an EWP/EWLP is transparent under UK taxation laws B Ltd and C Ltd each own 50% of the issued share capital of E Ltd. As both B Ltd and C Ltd are 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd this is a group for LTT purposes and if the requirements of group relief are met a claim may be made to relieve the liability arising on the market value of the property transferred. 
 
 
 
 
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% partnership interest each in ‘The Partnership’. ‘The Partnership’ owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) and Welsh Partnership (EWP) or an English(https://www.gov.wales/partnerships-and-land-transaction-tax-technical-guidance) Limited Partnership (EWLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ’The Partnership’ (EWP/EWLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 - identify the relevant owner or owners

 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x (100-50)% 
 Therefore the chargeable consideration for the transaction is 50% of the market value of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd (and therefore all the partners are grouped), group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge to B Ltd identified under partnership rules.

 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 – the sum of the lower proportions 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 ‘The Partnership’, as an EWP or EWLP, is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd.

As both B Ltd and C Ltd are 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd this is a group for LTT purposes and if the requirements of group relief are met a claim may be made to relieve the liability arising on the market value of the property transferred. 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – Scottish Partnerships (‘ScP‘) and Scottish Limited Partnerships (‘ScLP‘) 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Scottish Partnership (SP) or a Scottish Limited Partnership (ScLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner (C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner).  
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 We just have one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership, and as the transfer is from an ScP or ScLP, the partnership is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to SP/Sc LP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd, (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 The partnership, as a ScP or ScLP, is as regards chargeable interests held by the partnership, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by the partnership to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 An ScP/Sc LP has its own legal personality so it cannot be looked through to the partners to establish group relationships. For group relief to apply it is necessary to identify a group structure including the ScP/Sc LP. 
 As an ScP/ScLP is not a body corporate it does not meet the requirements of group relief (as a corporate body with issued share capital) so LTT is due on this transaction as a transfer from one company to another without the benefit of group relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Scottish Partnership (SP) or a Scottish Limited Partnership (ScLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner (C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner).  
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 We just have one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership, and as the transfer is from an ScP or ScLP, the partnership is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to SP/Sc LP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd, (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 The partnership, as a ScP or ScLP, is as regards chargeable interests held by the partnership, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by the partnership to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 An ScP/Sc LP has its own legal personality so it cannot be looked through to the partners to establish group relationships. For group relief to apply it is necessary to identify a group structure including the ScP/Sc LP. 
 As an ScP/ScLP is not a body corporate it does not meet the requirements of group relief (as a corporate body with issued share capital) so LTT is due on this transaction as a transfer from one company to another without the benefit of group relief. 
 
 
 
 
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd. ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Scottish Partnership (SP) or a Scottish Limited Partnership (ScLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (ScP/ScLP) to B Ltd. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner (C Ltd can not be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner).  
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 We just have one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership, and as the transfer is from an ScP or ScLP, the partnership is looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to SP/Sc LP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately before the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately after the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd, (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step Three was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability. 
 The partnership, as a ScP or ScLP, is as regards chargeable interests held by the partnership, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd to B Ltd and C Ltd, i.e. B Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to C Ltd. As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 As both the partnership calculation and the application of group relief result in a nil charge the liable person may decide which provisions they wish to use. 
 Transfer from company owned by partnership to corporate partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from E Ltd to B Ltd (a transfer from one of the companies owned by the partnership to one of the partners). 
 The partnership rules will not have any application in this example as it is not a transfer from or to a partnership. However, the group relief rules may apply. 
 For group relief to apply for LTT purposes the transfer must be between group companies and a company must be a body corporate and the 75% beneficial ownership test must be met. 
 An ScP/Sc LP has its own legal personality so it cannot be looked through to the partners to establish group relationships. For group relief to apply it is necessary to identify a group structure including the ScP/Sc LP. 
 As an ScP/ScLP is not a body corporate it does not meet the requirements of group relief (as a corporate body with issued share capital) so LTT is due on this transaction as a transfer from one company to another without the benefit of group relief. 
 
 Example of the application of reliefs: Group Relief – Limited Liability Partnerships 
 
 
   
 A Ltd owns 100% of the issued share capital of B Ltd and C Ltd. B Ltd and C Ltd own a 50% each partnership interest in ‘The Partnership’. The partnership owns 100% of the issued share capital in E Ltd and F Ltd and ‘The Partnership’ in the structure is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). 
 Transfer from partnership to company partner 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from ‘The Partnership’ (LLP) to B Ltd. This is a transfer from a partnership so the relevant provisions will apply and the LTT liability will be established using the transfer from a partnership rules. 
 Step 1 – identify the relevant owner or owners 
 B Ltd is a relevant owner because, immediately after the transaction, it is entitled to a proportion of the chargeable interest and immediately before the transaction it was a partner. 
 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately before the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 (C Ltd cannot be a corresponding partner as it is not an individual and is not a relevant owner) 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately after the transaction. 
 As there is only one corresponding partner, this proportion is all apportioned to B Ltd. 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner (here B Ltd) is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 In this case the figures are 100% (the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner) and 50% (the partnership share attributable to the partner) respectively, so the lower proportion is 50. 
 Step 5 
 There is just one lower proportion, so there is nothing to add together. As a result, the sum of the lower proportions in this instance is 50. 
 Chargeable consideration is MV x 50% = 50% 
 Therefore we have a 50% of the market value charge of the chargeable interest transferred. 
 The partnership as an LLP is as regards chargeable interests held by the LLP, looked through to the partners and this is effectively a transfer from B Ltd and C Ltd to B Ltd, i.e. C Ltd transfers its 50% interest in the property to B Ltd. 
 As B Ltd and C Ltd are both 100% subsidiaries of A Ltd group relief will be available if the conditions are met which will give relief against the charge identified under partnership rules. 
 Transfer from company partner to partnership 
 There is a transfer of a chargeable interest from B Ltd to LLP 
 This is a transfer to a partnership so the provision relating to a transfer to a partnership will the LTT liability will be established using the transfer to a partnership rules.

 Step 2 – for each relevant owner, identify the corresponding partner or partners 
 B Ltd is its own corresponding partner because, immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it was the relevant owner. 
 C Ltd is also a corresponding partner as immediately after the transaction it was a partner and it is connected to the relevant owner. Whilst C Ltd is prevented from being a corresponding partner under paragraph 16 (1)(b), because it is not an individual connected to the relevant owner and it isn’t itself a relevant owner, because the company is a member of the same group as the original owner (B Ltd) then it is a corresponding partners by virtue of the special rules relating to the calculation of the sum of the lower proportions for connected companies. 
 Step 3 
 B Ltd is entitled to 100% of the chargeable interest immediately before the transaction. There are 2 corresponding partners so this proportion can be apportioned between B Ltd and C Ltd (50:50). 
 Step 4 
 The lower proportion for each person who is a corresponding partner is the proportion of the chargeable interest attributable to the partner, or if lower, the partnership share attributable to the partner. 
 As the proportion of the chargeable interest attributed to each partner at Step 3 was 50 and the partnership share attributable to each partner is also 50 the lower proportion has to be 50 each. 
 Step 5 
 The 2 amounts added together (50 + 50) are 100. 
 As a result of the special rules (para 41) which allows C Ltd to be regarded as a corresponding partner despite being a company, the SLP in this instance is 100 so the chargeable consideration is nil and there is no LTT liability.

 Application of charities relief 
 (paragraph 42)  
 Where the conditions for charities relief are met the relief applies to all partnership transactions relating to transfers of an interest in a partnership or an interest in a property-investment partnership. However, the charities relief rules are to be read as though modified so as to provide for the relief to be available (see  paragraph 42 of Schedule 7 LTTA(http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2017/1/schedule/7) ). 
 Charities relief is available in these circumstances if the transferee is a charity and every chargeable interest held as partnership property immediately after the transfer must be held for qualifying charitable purposes. 
 Notification of transfer of partnership interest 
 (paragraph 44) 
 A transaction which is a chargeable transaction because it is either: 
 
 a transfer of an interest in a property-investment partnership and the relevant partnership property includes a chargeable interest, or 
 a transfer of a partnership interest pursuant to tax avoidance arrangements 
 
 is a notifiable transaction if (but only if) there is tax chargeable at a rate of more than 0% or any amount in respect to which tax would be chargeable but for a relief having been claimed.

392,392,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6010 Duty to deliver a land transaction tax return," (section 44) 
 A taxpayer must send the WRA a return for every notifiable land transaction that has either completed or has been substantially performed. 
 The return must be made within a 30 day period beginning on the day after the effective date of the transaction. Furthermore, where the transaction is also a chargeable transaction the return must also include a self-assessment. This time limit is calendar days and not working days. 
 The examples below show the filing dates where the land transaction occurs in a 30 day month and in a 31 day month. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Ms A acquires her new home and has no interest in any other dwelling. The transaction completes on 7 April 2020. The transaction had not been substantially performed prior to that date. Ms A therefore has until midnight on 7 May 2020 to submit her return in time.

393,393,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6020 Notifiable transactions," (section 45) 
 A notifiable transaction is one that is: 
 
 the acquisition of a major interest in land that is not covered by one of the exceptions detailed below 
 the acquisition of a chargeable interest other than a major interest in land that is not exempt from charge and tax is chargeable (or would be so chargeable were it not for a claim to a relief) at a rate of more than 0% 
 a land transaction that a person is treated as entering because of the substantial performance rules in relation to a contract providing for transfer to third party (section 11(3) LTTA), or 
 a notional or additional notional land transaction for a pre-completion transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 - acquisition of a major interest 
 
 
   
 Ms A has recently moved in with Mr B after many years in a relationship. Ms A owns no other property. It is agreed that Ms A will become a tenant in common in Mr B’s home which is now their joint home. The chargeable consideration given by Ms A for the interest is £100,000. While no tax is chargeable as the consideration is within the 0% threshold for residential transactions, the transaction is notifiable as she is deemed to have acquired a major interest in land as following the land transaction she and Mr B own the major interest jointly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 – acquisition of a chargeable interest other than a major interest 
 
 
   
 C Ltd pays Ms D, a farmer, £300,000 to erect 30 pylons on her land. The arrangement between the 2 parties is an easement and is therefore not a major interest in land, but is a chargeable interest in land. As the consideration given is greater than the 0% threshold for non-residential transactions, the transaction is notifiable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 – substantial performance 
 
 
   
 E Ltd has entered into a contract to purchase an office block. The terms of the contract provide that E Ltd may direct that the property is transferred to a third party (F Ltd). Prior to the transfer from the seller to F Ltd E Ltd, with the agreement of the seller, takes possession of the property to obtain access to other property they own. As E Ltd has substantially performed the contract by taking possession of the property the transaction will be notifiable, as will the transaction entered into by F Ltd. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 – notional pre-completion 
 
 
   
 A Ltd has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with B Ltd for some land with a consideration of £400,000 payable on completion. B Ltd assigned its rights under the contract to C Ltd for a payment by C Ltd of £50,000. 
 C Ltd completed the acquisition and paid A Ltd £400,000. The transaction between B Ltd and A Ltd is a notional land transaction and therefore a notifiable transaction, entered into by B Ltd, but a claim for full relief should be available if Section 19 of Schedule 2 applies. The transaction between C Ltd and B Ltd, entered into by C Ltd is also a notifiable transaction with chargeable consideration of £450,000.

394,394,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6030 Exceptions to the notifiable transaction rules," (section 46) 
 Where the following conditions apply, the transaction is not a notifiable transaction: 
 
 Exemptions:
	 
 a transaction which is exempt from charge 
 
 
 Transactions not involving a lease:
	 
 an acquisition other than a grant, assignment or surrender of a lease where the chargeable consideration (including any consideration for linked transactions) is less than £40,000 
 
 
 Leases less than 7 years:
	 
 the grant of a lease for a term of less than 7 years where the chargeable consideration does not exceed the 0% threshold 
 the assignment or surrender of a lease where it was originally granted for a term of less than 7 years and the chargeable consideration is not greater than the 0% threshold 
 
 
 Leases more than 7 years:
	 
 the grant of a lease for a term of 7 years or more where the chargeable consideration other than rent is less than £40,000 and the annual rent is less than £1,000, or 
 the assignment or surrender of a lease where it was originally granted for a term of 7 years or more and the chargeable consideration is less than £40,000. 
 
 
 
 The chargeable consideration exceeds the 0% threshold if it includes any amount on which tax is chargeable at a rate of more than 0% or would be so chargeable were it not for a claim to any relief. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A is gifted a dwelling from his mother. There is no outstanding debt (for example a mortgage) on the property. There is no chargeable consideration given. The transaction is exempt from charge and the transaction is not a notifiable transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 Ms B purchases a freehold piece of land costing £20,000. The transaction is not linked to any other transaction. As the chargeable consideration given is less than £40,000 the transaction is not a notifiable transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 C Ltd is granted a lease on a floor of an office block for a period of 5 years. The consideration given is £100,000 and it is wholly by way of consideration other than rent (a premium). There are no linked transactions. As the lease granted is for less than 7 years and the consideration is within the 0% threshold, the transaction is not notifiable. If the lease were to continue and no longer meet either the term or the consideration condition, the transaction would become notifiable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 
 
 
   
 D Ltd is granted a lease for a term of 6 years on 1 March 2020. The consideration given was wholly of consideration other than rent, and amounted to £200,000. This transaction was therefore notifiable as the consideration was greater than the 0% threshold. On 1 September 2024, the lease is assigned to E Ltd, an unconnected company, for £50,000. The transaction is not notifiable as the term of the lease when granted was for less than 7 years and consideration given for the assignment does not exceed the zero rate threshold. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 5 
 
 
   
 Mr F is granted a lease for a term of 15 years on a flat in Aberystwyth. The consideration is £35,000 premium and a ground rent of £600 per annum. The transaction is not notifiable as the consideration other than rent is less than £40,000 and the annual rent is less than £1,000.

 Where a transaction has been substantially performed, both the substantial performance of the contract and the completion of the contract can both be separate notifiable transactions unless the exceptions to the notifiable transaction rules apply. 
 Where the tax charged on the completion of the contract is higher than the amount of tax chargeable on the substantial performance of the contract, that additional amount must be included in the self-assessment for that return. The return for both the substantial performance of the contract and the return for the completion of the transaction must show the full amount of consideration payable known at the date each return is completed.

 Where the chargeable consideration in a notifiable transaction is uncertain, the taxpayer must, in the return for the notifiable transaction, calculate the chargeable consideration on a reasonable basis. 
 In addition a buyer must make a further return, including a self assessment to the WRA, in cases where the consideration was contingent, uncertain or unascertained within 30 days of when: 
 
 the contingency occurs or it becomes clear that it will not occur, or 
 for cases of uncertain or unascertained consideration, the amount relevant to the calculation of the consideration (or any part of the consideration) becomes known. 
 
 and if as a result of the event: 
 
 the transaction becomes notifiable 
 additional tax becomes payable, or 
 tax becomes payable for a transaction where none was payable before. 
 
 Interest also becomes due from 30 days after the date of the transaction to which the return or further return relates. 
 These rules do not apply to cases where the chargeable consideration is rent, nor to consideration paid as an annuity.

 Where, as a result of a relevant event occurring, there is less tax payable in respect of a land transaction, and the taxpayer has paid that tax, the taxpayer may make a claim to the WRA for repayment. 
 A relevant event in relation to the contingency, or the uncertain or unascertained consideration, is when: 
 
 the contingency occurs or it becomes clear that it will not occur or 
 for cases of uncertain or unascertained consideration, the amount relevant to the calculation of the consideration (or any part of the consideration) becomes known. 
 
 However, where the land transaction is related to the grant of a lease, no claim for repayment may be made in relation to: 
 
 the repayment (in whole or part) of any loan or deposit that was treated as consideration for the transaction, or 
 the refund of any consideration given where that refund is made under arrangements made in connection with the transaction and, is contingent on the termination or assignment of the lease (or the grant of a chargeable interest out of the lease). 
 
 The taxpayer may claim a repayment by amending their return, if within the time limits permitted, or after that period, by making a claim in writing to the WRA that complies with the relevant rules. The rules concerning claims for repayment normally only permit claims to be made within the period of 4 years following the filing date for the return. Exceptionally, the rules for repayment in relation to contingent, uncertain or unascertained cases, provide an additional period in which that claim may be made, when the usual 4 year period has passed. The additional period in which a claim may be made, is a period of 12 months, beginning with the relevant date that triggered the claim to repayment. 
 These rules do not apply to cases where the chargeable consideration is rent, nor to consideration paid as an annuity.

403,403,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6120 Declaration," (section 53) 
 A return must include a declaration by the buyer that the return is, to the best of their knowledge, correct and complete. 
 For a paper return this must be the buyer(s) signature(s). 
 Where the buyer has authorised an agent to complete the return, it is possible for the agent to complete, or be treated as completing, the declaration. 
 In cases where the declaration is made by the agent on behalf of the buyer, the buyer must have confirmed with their agent that, with the exception of the relevant date if necessary, the information in the return is correct and complete to the best of the buyer’s knowledge. If the buyer is in a position to confirm the relevant date to their agent, then the declaration is made by the agent on behalf of the buyer for the entire return. 
 However where the buyer has not been able to confirm the relevant date, then the agent is declaring on behalf of the buyer that all the information in the return is correct and complete to the best of the buyer’s knowledge, and that the relevant date is, to the best of the agent’s knowledge, also correct. 
 Therefore there are 3 different declarations on the tax return: 
 
 A declaration by the buyer who is completing the tax return themselves 
 A declaration by an agent on behalf of the buyer that all information in the tax return, including the relevant date, has been confirmed by the buyer to be complete and correct to the best of the buyer’s knowledge 
 A declaration by an agent on behalf of the buyer that all the information in the tax return, except the relevant date, has been confirmed by the buyer to be complete and correct to the best of the buyer’s knowledge, and the agent is declaring themselves that the relevant date is correct to the best of the agent’s knowledge. 
 
 The relevant date means, in most cases, the effective date of the transaction. However, special rules apply for the following cases when the relevant date is:  
 
 the date on which the event occurs, that means a return must be made as a result of a contingency occurring (or it becomes clear it will not occur) or the consideration, where uncertain or unascertained, is ascertained 
 the date on which the disqualifying event occurs, that results in a further return being required as a result of a relief being withdrawn 
 the effective date of the transaction for the later linked transaction which triggers the requirement to make a return in relation to an earlier transaction, or 
 the effective date of the transaction that triggers the requirement to make a return for an interim transaction in relation to a higher rates residential property transaction.

407,407,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6160 Deferral of Tax – Contingent or uncertain consideration," (section 58) 
 Where consideration is contingent, the taxpayer must, in the return for the transaction, calculate the chargeable consideration on the basis that the outcome of the contingency is that consideration will be payable, or will not cease to be payable. 
 Where the consideration is uncertain, the taxpayer must, in the return for the transaction, calculate the chargeable consideration on a reasonable basis. 
 See the guidance at  LTTA/2440(/chargeable-consideration-technical-guidance#5174)  for more information about what is ‘contingent’ and what is ‘uncertain’ consideration. 
 For both cases where the consideration is contingent or uncertain, but not for cases where the consideration is unascertained at the effective date of the transaction, the taxpayer may request that the tax arising on the contingent or uncertain consideration is deferred. However, a deferral request can only be made if the contingent or uncertain consideration, or part of it, is payable more than 6 months after the effective date of the transaction. 
 Deferral requests cannot be made where the consideration is not contingent or uncertain, but is being paid in instalments to the seller. 
 Where the taxpayer wishes to defer tax they must: 
 
 make the return and deferral request on or before the filing date for the return 
 specify the amount to be deferred 
 provide the calculation of the amount to be deferred ( LTTA/6230(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5598) ) 
 set out why the consideration is contingent or uncertain and why the deferred consideration is to be paid at a future date 
 propose an expected end date ( LTTA/6180(/land-transaction-tax-returns-and-payments-technical-guidance#5581) ) for the deferral period (or state a date 5 years from the effective date if the expected end cannot be predicted) 
 make the deferral request in a manner that meets the requirements for the taxpayer to give notices to the WRA. 
 
 If the taxpayer’s request meets these requirements, as long as the WRA is satisfied that the amount requested to be deferred does not exceed the deferrable amount and the land transaction is not a tax avoidance arrangement (or part of such an arrangement), the WRA must accept the request. 
 Where the WRA is not satisfied that the request meets the conditions, it must refuse the request. 
 However, where the WRA believes that the amount requested to be deferred by the taxpayer exceeds the correct deferrable amount, but all other aspects of the request comply with the requirements, it may grant a deferral of an amount that it believes is correct. Similarly, where the WRA believes that the end date of the deferral period differs from that requested by the taxpayer it may determine a different date.

 The deferral period begins with the filing date for the return and ends with the earlier of: 
 
 the expected end date, or 
 if the deferred consideration is contingent - the date on which the contingency occurs (or it is clear that it will not occur), or 
 if the deferred consideration is uncertain - the date the consideration becomes ascertained. 
 
 The effect of this rule is that where a taxpayer’s deferral request is agreed, if the deferred consideration is paid earlier than the expected end date, the taxpayer is under an obligation to pay the relevant amount of tax associated with that deferred consideration.

 determine the expected date on which the deferral period ends

 the expected end date of the deferral period 
 any conditions the WRA makes in relation to the deferred amount, and 
 if the deferred amount is lower than requested by the taxpayer the reason for that decision.

 WRA agreement to deferral request 
 Where a deferral request has been agreed, the taxpayer must pay the deferred amount (or amounts when there are several relevant deferral dates), before the end of the day on which the deferral period ends. 
 Interest on the deferred amount will start accruing on the date following the date on which that amount should have been paid. The effect of this is that interest is not charged during the period of the deferral, but is charged from the day after the date the deferral period ends. 
 Where a taxpayer makes an estimate of the uncertain consideration that is lower than the actual additional consideration that later has to be paid, late payment interest will apply to the difference between the deferred amount and the actual additional consideration paid. This interest will date back to the payment date of the original transaction. The interest on the amount that was deferred will start to accrue on the date following the date on which the amount should have been paid.

The land transaction occurred on 1 September 2020.The return for that transaction was made on 20 September 2020 on the same day a deferral request was sent to the WRA. It was received on 24 September 2020. The return shows £200,000 tax payable. The deferral request results in £50,000 being payable by 1 October 2020 with the remainder payable in 2 separate amounts related to separate and distinct contingencies in the contract. The first, if the contingency occurs, is due to be paid on 1 November 2021 (resulting in £30,000 tax), and the second on 1 March 2022 (resulting in £120,000 tax). The first deferred amount of tax is due to be paid on 2 November (the day after the deferral period ends). A Ltd does not make payment of this amount of tax until 20/12/2021. Interest therefore accrues over the period from 3 November 2021 until 19 December 2021. A Ltd pays the tax due on the second contingency on time on 2 March 2022. No interest accrues on this amount. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 B Ltd makes a deferral request that WRA agrees in full. The land transaction occurred on 1 September 2020 and included an overage clause. This stated that, should the buyer obtain planning permission for a residential development, then 50% of the uplift in the value of the land should be paid to the seller as additional consideration. The return for that transaction was made on 20 September 2020 on the same day that a deferral request was sent to WRA. The return was received on 24 September 2020 and showed £100,000 tax payable and included a reasonable estimate of the future value of the land (should B Ltd obtain planning permission). The deferral request results in £75,000 being payable by 1 October 2020, with the remaining £25,000 payable if the taxpayer obtains planning permission within 5 years. 
 The taxpayer obtains planning permission for a residential development on 1 October 2022, which results in the land rising in value by more than the taxpayer originally estimated. This results in an additional LTT charge of £30,000, which is £5000 more than was included in their deferral request. Provided that B Ltd makes a return and pays the additional tax by 1 November 2022, then the deferred amount of £25,000 will not accrue interest. The remaining £5000 of tax will accrue interest from 2 October 2020.

 WRA rejection (in full or part) of a deferral request 
 If the deferral request is refused in part or full then the amount of the tax that has been refused to be deferred must be paid by the later of: 
 
 the date on which the taxpayer receives the notice of WRA’s decision, or 
 the filing date for the return 
 
 If the taxpayer disagrees with the decision, they may ask for a review of the decision or appeal against the decision.  
 Interest on the amount the WRA does not agree should be deferred, starts to accrue on the later of the date on which: 
 
 the taxpayer receives notice of the WRA’s decision, or 
 the filing date for the return. 
 
 The effect of this is that the taxpayer does not accrue interest on late payment of tax during the period that the WRA is considering the deferral request. However, interest is accrued as soon as the taxpayer becomes aware of the WRA’s decision.

412,412,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6210 Variations of deferral requests," (section 62) 
 Once the WRA has agreed to a deferral request the taxpayer may ask for a variation to that deferral agreement. The request for a variation can only relate to: 
 
 a change to the expected end date, or 
 the variation or removal of a condition imposed by the WRA. 
 
 Any request for a variation must also be accompanied by an explanation of the change in circumstances that has led the taxpayer to believe that the deferral decision should be changed, varied, or removed. 
 The WRA may agree or refuse the request. The WRA must send a notice of its decision in relation to the deferral request, including the reasons for that decision, to the taxpayer. If the taxpayer disagrees with the decision they may ask for a review of the decision or appeal against the decision.

413,413,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6220 Failure to comply with the WRA’s agreement to defer," (section 63) 
 There may be situations where the WRA believes that the taxpayer has failed to comply with a condition that is part of the agreement (or the varied agreement), or that the taxpayer has provided false or misleading information or has withheld information from the WRA. In such a situation the deferral request is treated as never having been made, and, as a result, interest accrues from the day after the filing date for the return. 
 If the WRA wishes to undo the deferral request it must issue a notice to the taxpayer setting out the decision and the reasons for that decision. If the taxpayer disagrees with the decision they may ask for a review of the decision or appeal against the decision.

414,414,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6230 Calculation of deferrable amount," (section 59) 
 The deferrable amount must be calculated in the following manner: 
 Step 1 
 Calculate the amount of tax chargeable on the chargeable consideration. 
 Step 2 
 Determine the amount of the chargeable consideration that is the deferred chargeable consideration. This is the amount of the chargeable consideration that: 
 
 has not been paid (but is not rent or an annuity) 
 is contingent or uncertain 
 does not consist of rent (as defined under Schedule 6 LTTA) or an annuity to which section 21 LTTA applies, and 
 is to be paid on one or more future dates that fall more than 6 months after the effective date of the transaction. 
 
 Step 3 
 Calculate the amount of tax chargeable on the amount of chargeable consideration, less the amount of deferred chargeable consideration. That is, the amount of the chargeable consideration less the amount established at Step 2. 
 Step 4 
 Deduct the amount of tax established at Step 3 from the amount established at Step 1. The amount of tax established is the deferrable amount. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd acquires an office building from B Ltd in the centre of Wrexham. The consideration given is £500,000 with a further £300,000 payable if planning permission is granted for the building to be altered to residential flats. The building is acquired on 1 June 2021 and the initial £500,000 paid. A Ltd sends in its return on 20 June 2021 showing the chargeable consideration as £800,000 with a request to defer the tax on the £300,000 contingent amount. A Ltd anticipates that the planning decision will be made by 1 February 2022, following plans being drawn up and submitted. 
 A Ltd establishes the deferrable amount of tax using the 4 steps in the following manner: 
 
 tax on chargeable consideration of £800,000 is £27,750 
 deferred chargeable consideration is £300,000 (£800,000-£500,000) 
 tax on chargeable consideration of £500,000 (i.e. chargeable consideration (£800,000) reduced by the deferred chargeable consideration (£300,000)) is £12,750 
 the tax that is the deferrable amount (amount of tax at step 3 (£12,750) deducted from the amount of tax at step 1 (£27,750) is £15,000. 
 
 A Ltd can therefore make a request for £13,000 of tax to be deferred. A tax return could become due when the contingency ceases or the consideration is ascertained.

415,415,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Returns and payments,LTTA/6240 Registration of land transactions," (section 65) 
 The LTT legislation provides that no notifiable land transaction, and no document evidencing or effecting such a transaction, can be registered at HM Land Registry unless a WRA certificate is issued by the WRA, evidencing the submission of a duly completed land transaction return. 
 Before a WRA certificate is issued, the WRA must be satisfied that: 
 
 a return for the transaction has been received, and 
 the return is complete (see below) and includes a declaration. 
 
 If the return is a chargeable transaction the WRA must also be satisfied that: 
 
 the return includes a self-assessment, and 
 on the basis of the information in the return, the self-assessment appears to be correct. 
 
 A return is considered to be complete for the purposes of issuing a WRA certificate, if it is capable of being made online or is capable of being captured electronically by the WRA, if in paper. The issuing of the WRA certificate is not a confirmation that the return made by the taxpayer is correct, or that the self-assessed tax has been paid. The WRA may still make corrections to, or enquire into returns for which a WRA certificate has been issued. 
 A WRA certificate must be in writing and must contain the following information: 
 
 the address of the land 
 the title number of the land in the Land Register (if provided to WRA in the return) 
 the National Land and Property Gazetteer Unique Property Reference Number (if provided to WRA in the return) 
 the description of the transaction 
 the effective date of the transaction 
 the name of the buyer and the seller. 
 
 The certificate must accompany the relevant application to enable the land transaction to be registered at HM Land Registry. 
 The WRA may provide duplicate certificates if it is satisfied that the original has been lost or destroyed. That duplicate certificate can either be a WRA certificate equivalent to and replacing the original, or a new WRA certificate superseding the original. 
 Where a single land transaction return relates to a transaction involving a number of properties, (that is a number of title numbers), the taxpayer may ask the WRA to provide separate WRA certificates for each property transferred. In the absence of such a request, a single WRA certificate will be issued. 
 However, a WRA certificate issued for a transaction that is a land transaction for the purposes of LTTA, but is not a land transaction for the purposes of HM Land Registry, should not be sent to HM Land Registry. Transactions that are land transactions for LTTA but not for HM Land Registry include: 
 
 contracts that are substantially performed 
 notional and additional notional transactions for pre-completion transactions 
 agreements to lease treated as a land transaction, and 
 variations of a lease treated as a land transaction. 
 
 Special rules apply to transactions where there is land, transferred as part of a single land transaction, in both Wales and England.

417,417,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1010 Meaning of major interest," (section 68) A major interest in land is: an estate in fee simple absolute (a freehold interest), or a term of years absolute (a leasehold interest) whether in law or in equity. For the purposes of the LTT higher rates, paragraph 29 of Schedule 5 clarifies that the transfer of beneficial interests (for example undivided shares) arising under a trust in a residential property will be treated in the same way as a transfer of a major interest, where the seller of the beneficial interest was: immediately prior to the transaction, deemed to own the major interest in the dwelling, and  immediately after the transaction the buyer is deemed to own the major interest

418,418,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1020 Meaning of subject-matter and main subject-matter," (section 69) The subject-matter of a transaction means the chargeable interest acquired in the land transaction (the ‘main subject-matter’) including any interest or right appurtenant* or pertaining to it that is acquired with it (relating to the main subject-matter). * ‘Appurtenant’ means any right or restriction which goes with that property, such as an easement to gain access across adjoining land owned by another, or a covenant i.e. agreement to refrain from an activity for the benefit of the adjoining land. For example, the transfer of a freehold and the transfer or creation or variation of a related right of way is chargeable as one transaction rather than 2 as the right of way is part of the same subject-matter. In most cases the transaction will include a single registered title for the property and land. In some cases, a transaction may contain several registered titles for what, is in effect, a single property, made up of a property and its land. The consequences of selling a property and its land as a single transaction, made up of several registered titles is that there are in effect several chargeable interests that as a general rule would be considered as linked transactions. The WRA would expect the tax treatment to match the treatment that would apply had a single registered title covering the same property and land been the subject of the transaction. Therefore one would not expect a tax advantage to arise from dividing a property and its land into separate titles if those titles form part of a single transaction or series of linked transactions.

419,419,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1030 Meaning of market value," (section 70) Market value for LTT is determined in the same way as for the purposes of sections 272 to 274 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Where the consideration for a land transaction is satisfied by the transfer of an asset, services or other non-monetary consideration, the market value of that asset etc. will be the price which the asset etc. might reasonably be expected to have cost in the open market. This is the case even where consideration is given. The market value of an asset etc. does not normally include Value Added Tax (VAT) even if VAT is chargeable on the transfer of the asset etc. This is because market value is based on a hypothetical transaction, not on the actual transaction. However, there are in LTT a number of circumstances where the amount of VAT actually paid, or notionally payable, by the taxpayer on the transaction must be added to the market value established. These rules apply in relation to the calculation of chargeable consideration for: exchanges carrying out of works, and the provision of services Where the amount of the chargeable consideration needs to be established using a market valuation it is the buyer’s responsibility to provide it and the WRA will not prepare, or agree before a return is made, valuations for a taxpayer. The valuation of assets etc. can be a complex matter requiring professional qualifications. In taking reasonable care in filing their tax return, a taxpayer may want to consider obtaining a valuation from a person competent to do so and who has been instructed to provide a valuation for the purpose of the tax legislation. If a tax return contains errors relating to valuation, a failure to instruct an appropriately qualified valuer may be relevant to assessing whether there should be a penalty and the type of penalty. Appropriate evidence of the valuation should be retained. Where the WRA needs to establish a valuation, or wishes to check a taxpayer’s valuation, it will employ a professional valuer.

420,420,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1040 Meaning of effective date of transaction," (section 71) The effective date of a transaction determines when a liability to LTT arises. It also determines when the filing obligations arise. The general rule is that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a land transaction is when that land transaction is completed. There are important exceptions to this general rule: substantial performance ( LTTA/2150(/particular-transactions-technical-guidance#4931) ) options and rights of pre-emption ( LTTA/2240(/particular-transactions-technical-guidance#4974) ) agreement to lease ( LTTA/4100(/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance#6098) ) In cases where the taxpayer is entering into a lease that continued after a fixed term or a lease granted for an indefinite term ( LTTA/4030(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance) ) where the return asks the taxpayer to enter the effective date of the transaction, please use the day after the end of the period for which the lease is treated as continuing. In cases where the taxpayer is entering into a rent reconsideration ( LTTA/4090(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-leases-technical-guidance) ) where the return asks the taxpayer to enter the effective date of the transaction, please use the day after the day of the rent reconsideration.

421,421,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1050 Meaning of residential property," (section 72) Residential property is defined as: a building, or part of a building, that is used or suitable for use as one or more dwellings, or is in the process of being constructed or adapted for such use land that is or forms part of the garden or grounds of such a building (including any building or structure on such land) an interest in or right over land that subsists, or is to subsist, for the benefit of such a building or such land For most taxpayers it should be obvious when they are acquiring residential property. For example a building that has been in use as a dwelling up until the point of sale, including the garden or grounds will clearly be residential property. A chargeable transaction is a residential property transaction and subject to the residential property LTT rates and bands where the property transferred consists entirely of an interest that is residential property. Where the property transferred does not consist entirely of an interest in residential property then the non-residential property LTT rates and bands apply to that transaction. In cases where a building contains a dwelling and something else (for example, a shop with a flat above it), or where the dwelling has land that is not part of the garden or grounds (for example, a farmhouse with farmland), the treatment will be that the building acquired is either itself a mixture of residential and non-residential property, or is part of a transaction that includes both residential and non-residential property, and therefore the interest is not solely of residential property and the non-residential LTT rates will apply to the transaction. It is worth noting that, as explained in the higher rates section of the guidance, the acquisition of a non-residential property that includes a dwelling isn’t chargeable to higher residential property LTT rates and bands. However this doesn’t stop the dwelling part of that acquisition being subsequently taken into account as a dwelling when assessing how many dwellings a person holds for the purposes of the higher rates rules.

422,422,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1051 Is the building a dwelling?," The use (or suitability of use) of the property as a dwelling is to be assessed at the effective date of the transaction. If, at that date, the property is used as a dwelling or is suitable for use as a dwelling, then it is a dwelling. It is not necessary for the seller to be in occupation on the effective date of the transaction for the building to be used as a dwelling. The buyer’s proposed future use of the building does not, of itself, determine the building’s current use or suitability for a different future use. To determine whether a building is a dwelling or suitable for use as it will be helpful to consider the physical configuration of the building. No single factor will determine whether a property is a dwelling; different factors must be taken into account. Indicative factors include: a toilet and washing facilities accommodation for both ‘living’ and sleeping a kitchen Other factors include the property’s treatment for the purposes of local government finance or status under planning laws, discussed later in this section. Where an individual taxpayer acquires: residential property with more than one dwelling within its boundary, and where one of which is to replace their main residence or where they own no other dwellings, higher rates may not apply to the transaction if certain conditions around principal and subsidiary dwellings are met. See our guidance at  LTTA/8080(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5219)  for more information on subsidiary dwellings. Treatment for purposes of local government finance and status under planning laws In considering the use (and suitability for use) of a building, it can be helpful to have regard to the building’s treatment for the purposes of local government finance and its status under the planning laws. A building will often be subject to Council Tax or Non-Domestic Rates (or in some cases both) depending on whether or not the building is being used or is suitable for use for residential or business purposes. The general assumption is that the actual use of a building will follow the permitted use of the building. For example, if an entire building is being used at the effective date of the transaction as an office, then it is likely that Non-Domestic Rates (NDR) are being paid and the building is permitted to be used as an office. In the event that the building is being used as an accountant’s office but the building can only properly be used for residential purposes, then the building will still be treated as suitable for use as a dwelling, and the residential rates of LTT will apply. If, in order to convert an office (or change its use) into a dwelling, appropriate permission from the relevant planning authority is required, then the absence of that permission at the effective date of the transaction would be a strong indicator that property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, even if little physical alteration would be required to make it habitable (for example an office located in a converted townhouse). As such the building would be a non-residential property. That does not necessarily mean that the existence of appropriate permission, at the effective date of the transaction, to use a non-residential property as a dwelling means that the building is suitable for use as a dwelling. It will still be necessary to consider whether the building is physically suitable for use as a dwelling. If significant construction or adaption of the building would be required to make it suitable for use as a dwelling, then that is an indication that the building would not be suitable for use as a dwelling prior to the carrying out of that work. If, on the other hand, a dwelling house is unoccupied and is instead used temporarily by the seller to store goods (stock) for resale, then, assuming no change of use consent is required to continue to use the building as a dwelling in future, then this will be residential property. During the period that the building was being used as a temporary stock room, it is still subject to Council Tax rather than NDR and is only suitable for use as a dwelling. Planning permission may not be required to home work or run a business from home, provided that the dwelling house remains a private residence first and business second (or in planning terms, provided that a business does not result in a material change of use of a property so that it is no longer a single dwelling house). Therefore the fact that a business is carried on from a building does not prevent the building from either being used as a dwelling or suitable for use as a dwelling. For example converting a room into an office does not prevent the building from being residential property if the rest of the property is used as a dwelling or the building is suitable for use as a dwelling, because no permission would be required to continue to use the building as a dwelling. The building will be subject to Council Tax rather than NDR given its primary use is as a dwelling. However, it should be noted that a building will be a dwelling if it is in the process of being constructed or adapted for use as a dwelling (see  LTTA/1053(/land-transaction-tax-interpretation-provisions-technical-guidance#31363) ). Bed and breakfasts, guest houses and holiday lettings Where a building has been used partly for residential purposes and partly for another purpose, its overall suitability for use as a dwelling will be influenced by the primary use to which the property may be put. For example a building in use as a bed and breakfast or guest house will be a residential, mixed, or non-residential land transaction based on the facts in each case. The current use of the building, taking into consideration the planning permission requirements if there was to be a change of use to a dwelling, as well as whether the property is subject to Council Tax and/or NDR will be a strong indicator in these types of cases as to the suitable use of the property acquired. Therefore: if Non-Domestic Rates are payable and the rest of the property cannot or should not be used for domestic purposes, then the property is likely be considered to be non-residential if non-domestic rates and council tax are payable on the respective business and residential parts of the house, and permission would be required to convert the entire house into a dwelling house, then the property is likely to be considered to be of mixed use and the non-residential rates will apply if only council tax is paid, perhaps because the provision of bed and breakfast accommodation is secondary to the primary residential use (as would also potentially be the case of a home office) and the house should only be used as a dwelling house, then the property is likely to be considered to be suitable for use as a dwelling and will be residential property. A property used as part of a furnished holiday letting business will be a residential property whether the property is assessed to Council Tax or NDR, as in most cases the building could be used as a single dwelling house without permission from the relevant local authority. Specific cases The legislation identifies certain properties that are to be treated as a dwelling and certain properties which are not to be treated as a dwelling (see the definition of non-residential property below). Those which are treated as dwellings for LTT purposes are: residential accommodation for school pupils residential accommodation for students (other than halls of residence for students in further or higher education) residential accommodation for members of the armed forces an institution that is the sole or main residence of at least 90 per cent of its residents (and does not fall within any of the descriptions below of buildings not treated as dwellings below) It should be noted that a dwelling acquired with the intention of letting to students is not residential accommodation for students (other than halls of residence). There must be some characteristic over and above the intended (or already existing) tenants to make a property one that is residential accommodation for students. The planning permissions for such a property will be important. For example, a block of flats may have a planning restriction that means that they may only be let to students.

423,423,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1052 Derelict properties and removal of fixtures and fittings," A residential property that is no longer habitable as a dwelling, as it is derelict, would not be taxed at the residential rates, on the basis that it is not suitable for use as a dwelling. A transaction is likely to be taxed at residential rates if at the effective date the dwelling: was used as a dwelling previously and permission to use as a dwelling continues to exist is only in need of modernisation, renovation or repair; and the repair work does not require changing the structural nature of the property Where a property may be considered derelict Where the damage to a dwelling is beyond the extent that normal repair work, replacement or modernisation can resolve, the property may not be suitable for use as a dwelling. This depends on the severity of the damage. If on the effective date:  the structural integrity of the property is compromised to the extent that without significant repair work it would be deemed to be unsafe to live in; or the repair work requires demolishing the existing structure then the property is likely to be unsuitable for use as a dwelling and taxed at the non-residential rates. Repairs to the interior of the property are unlikely to fall within this category unless it is in addition to repairing structural defects that are hazardous without repair. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A and Mrs A purchase a farmhouse. On the effective date of the transaction, the farmhouse had severe structural damage and required replacing of some of the timbers supporting the property. The roof had fallen in places, so the interior of the property had been exposed to the elements. The floors and ceilings upstairs were rotten and had given way in places. Access to the property was not secure and required installation of windows and doors. The property had never been connected to the mains electric or mains water and there was no sign of connection to sewerage pipes. There was no bathroom or kitchen. As the property requires extensive rebuilding of its structure to make it safe to live in, this property is likely to be viewed as not suitable for use as a dwelling and chargeable to the non-residential rates of LTT.

 Mr B purchases a property which was formerly used as a dwelling. At some point in its history it had suffered severe fire damage, and not lived in since. As a result, there is no floor upstairs, and the circuity and pipework through the house cannot be used. All doors and windows are missing. There is visible structural damage to the building, and a survey has been conducted which says the property is structurally unsafe.  This property is likely to be viewed as not suitable for use as a dwelling and chargeable to the non-residential rates of LTT.

The only means of removing the asbestos was to dismantle the property in its entirety and as such extensive replacements would not bear any relation to the type of structure that was originally supporting the property. This property is likely to be viewed as not suitable for use as a dwelling and chargeable to the non-residential rates of LTT.

 Suitable for use as a dwelling It is normal for a part or parts of a property to wear out over time and require some replacements. This does not necessarily mean the property isn’t suitable for use as a dwelling. A normal repair as part of the general upkeep of the property would include: fitting of kitchen or bathroom facilities repairing or replacing windows paintwork rewiring repair work to roof including a re-slate, re-tile or re-thatch reconnection to utilities such as fitting of boiler for heating and replacement of piping to access water repair work or replacement of supporting timbers repair work as a result of water or fire damage Removal of fixtures and fittings  Where a dwelling does not contain fixtures and fittings such as a bathroom suite or kitchen facilities before sale it will still be regarded as suitable for use as a dwelling. These are internal fittings and could be fitted relatively quickly and cheaply and are common improvements to a dwelling. Likewise substantial repairs to the windows or the roof would not prevent the building being suitable for use as a dwelling.

 Mr F purchases a detached property. At some point, there had been a water leak causing some water damage to the flooring, insulation and some of the circuity. There was also damage to the ceiling where water had been retained. The building itself is still structurally sound.  Whilst the property had some damage, the property was safe to inhabit and repairable. The wet damage could be resolved through the removal and replacement of the wet flooring and insulation. Any damaged circuity could be easily replaced. This property is likely to be suitable for use as a dwelling and chargeable to the residential rates of LTT.

 How the property is viewed by other authorities Just because a property is exempt from council tax does not mean it is not suitable for use as a dwelling. It is also important to note that the inability to obtain a mortgage does not influence whether a property is suitable for use as a dwelling or not for LTT purposes. A prohibition order or an emergency prohibition order made under the Housing Act 2004 may be evidence that a property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, however, this will only be the case where the order requires works in excess of normal repair works, replacement or modernisation.

424,424,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1053 Construction or adaption for use as a dwelling," It is an objective test as to whether a building is in the process of adaption or construction for use as a dwelling at the effective date. Intention alone would not be sufficient. For example, obtaining planning permission for a building would not necessarily change the status of the building, if work on the property in line with the planning permission had not yet commenced at the effective date. However if adaption or construction had taken place at the effective date, then clearly the planning permission would be a strong indicator of what the building is being adapted for use as (for example, is the permission to convert or adapt the building to a dwelling, or into a commercial property?). Residential properties that are in the process of being constructed may be treated as dwellings at the point when walls begin to be constructed upon the foundations. Those walls do not have to be above ground level. Where walls have started to be built at the effective date the land will be residential property if the building being constructed is to be a dwelling. Where a building includes a number of dwellings (for example, a block of flats), all the dwellings in the building will be treated as being in the process of being constructed when the walls begin to be constructed, not when construction of each individual dwelling is commenced. This principle applies even if the ground floor is intended for non-residential use (for example, where the building consists of a shop with flats above). This will apply where a single, or multiple dwellings are sold. However, where the incomplete building is one that is for mixed use and the whole of the site is sold in a single transaction then the non-residential rates will apply. This will mean that a bare piece of land sold to a property developer will be non-residential land. If that developer were to sell the land after commencing the build of the properties, and none or some of the properties have reached the point of amounting to the construction of walls, then the transaction will be either one that is a non-residential, or a mixed, property transaction and will need to be assessed using the non-residential rates of LTT. Acquisition of 6 or more dwellings Where all the dwellings being constructed have reached the point where walls are considered to be in the process of being constructed, the transaction will be a residential property transaction and, the taxpayer may make a claim to multiple dwellings relief or opt to have the transaction treated as non-residential in the event that the transaction consists of 6 or more such dwellings. Where the construction work has resulted in some, but not all, of the dwellings being in the process of being constructed then the taxpayer may claim multiple dwellings relief in relation those dwellings and non-residential rates in relation to the rest of the land. Off-plan property purchases Where a taxpayer buys bare land that has: planning permission for a dwelling, and construction of the dwelling has not begun, and the seller is under no obligation to build a dwelling then the purchase will be taxed at the non-residential rates of LTT. This is in contrast to where an off- plan purchase that comprises both the land and a contract for the construction of a dwelling. This will be treated as a residential property transaction. It should be noted that there are special rules for off-plan property acquisitions in relation to whether they are deemed to be an acquisition or holding of a dwelling for the purposes of the higher rates rules (see  LTTA/8050(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#section-5209)  for the higher rates rules and  LTTA/7040(/land-transaction-tax-relief-acquisitions-involving-multiple-dwellings-technical-guidance#section-7285)  for relief for acquisitions involving multiple dwellings)

425,425,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1054 Garden and grounds," An acquisition of bare land will generally be a non-residential transaction. Whereas a transaction is likely to be residential if at the effective date the purchased land: forms part of the garden or grounds of a dwelling is for the benefit of the dwelling How to determine if land is garden or grounds It will be a question of fact. In most cases, land attached and acquired with a dwelling will be garden and grounds, making it residential. However, land does not have to be acquired with a dwelling for it to meet these conditions. Land acquired separately from a dwelling needs to be assessed at the ‘effective date’ to determine if it’s residential or not. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A homeowner sells their garden to a developer. The purchase is a residential property transaction. The developer then decides to build a small warehouse on that land and sells the warehouse to a local business. The second purchase of the land, including the warehouse, is a non-residential property transaction. Because the land sold no longer forms part of the garden or grounds of a dwelling, nor does it subsist for the benefit of the dwelling.

 Whether land forms part of the garden of grounds of a dwelling, (including any building or structure on such garden and grounds) or subsists for the benefit of the dwelling will be a question of fact depending on the individual circumstances of each case. For most dwellings, it will be clear what are: the gardens or grounds of that dwelling those parcels of land that are not Where there’s some question over this, it will be helpful to consider whether the land has a separate self-standing function or has been used to conduct a business or trade. Land does not have to be actively in use for it to be classed as either garden and grounds or as non-residential land. Its last use is indicative of its nature. Farming and rural land As stated, in most cases, land attached to a dwelling will be treated as garden or grounds. The main exception to this is farmland, which is clearly neither garden nor grounds of a farmhouse. Farmland is likely to have been exploited by commercial machinery. At the effective date it would be hard to class this land as garden or grounds. But land not commercially used will be considered gardens, or ‘grounds’. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Grounds could include a property with stabling for horses used for the seller’s or their friends and family’s personal use. Where the land (not constituting a garden) would amount to grounds, this would make the whole of the land and buildings sold residential.

 Tests to help decide if land is not part of garden and grounds There will be some cases where it’s not as clear whether land: forms part of the garden and grounds of a dwelling, or is non-residential The following indicative factors may help to determine whether land has been used to conduct business or trade. If so, it will be non-residential. These tests should apply to how the seller of the property used the land. Where the seller has permitted another party to access and exploit the land, this party’s use of the land should also be considered against these tests. 
 
 These are not definitive tests. If a parcel of land meets these criteria it does not certainly mean that it will be considered non-residential land for LTT purposes. 
 
 1. Has there been an activity undertaken on the land done so earnestly to pursue business interests instead of undertaken for pleasure, enjoyment or convenience? For example, a working sheep farm producing meat, milk and wool is more likely to meet this test. Whereas, a dwelling with some small fields within its boundary under a grazing agreement is not, unless there is further evidence of commercial exploitation of the land.  Similarly, a house that’s purchased with land as an investment with the hope of selling that land for a profit later is unlikely to meet this test. 2. Has the activity undertaken on the purchased land been undertaken on sound and recognised business principles? This means there has been genuine economic or commercial use of land. Examples of recognised business principles include: accurate record-keeping being VAT-registered (where appropriate) having contracts in place for the supply of goods and services 3. Has the activity undertaken on the land had a reasonable prospect of profit and the intention of generating a reasonable income relative to the land value? For example, a dwelling is acquired with a neighbouring field that the previous owner had used to keep chickens. The previous owner sold both eggs and chicks, from which she gained a reasonable income but ran at a loss. This is unlikely to be viewed as a business undertaking and is likely to make the land residential. 4. Has the activity undertaken on that land been done so with reasonable continuity? For example, a dwelling purchased with a nearby field used as a campground for only a couple of weeks a year, coinciding with a festival event, is unlikely to be classed as non-residential. 5. How is the land viewed by other public authorities? For example, land that receives rural payments is more likely to be classed non-residential than land that does not. For this test to be met the rural payment should be paid on the basis of the purchased land alone. Where a small amount of land, which is too small to qualify for a rural payment in its own right, is used by a neighbouring farmer under a grazing agreement. And that land is combined with the neighbouring farmers’ own land to qualify for a rural payment. This is unlikely to meet the test. Land that’s exempt from Council Tax or Non-Domestic Rates (NDR) as it’s deemed agricultural is more likely to be viewed as non-residential than land that does not have such an exemption. 6. Has the local authority granted planning permission or other permissions or licences indicative of a business use of the land? For example, a campsite will have: planning permission for the construction of toilet and washing facilities a licence from the local authority to operate as a campsite Buildings on the land Buildings on the land must be included when considering whether a property is residential or mixed/non-residential. If those buildings are in the garden and grounds of the dwelling, then the use or suitable use of those other buildings is not relevant. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 If a garage within the grounds of a dwelling is converted into an office, then this alone will not prevent the land and the office from being part of the dwelling’s gardens. It would be residential property. But if the use of those buildings is strongly indicative of a business use, for example, they’re subject to NDR, then the transaction will be subject to the non-residential rates of LTT as it will be a mixed transaction.

 Land that subsists for the benefit of a dwelling Land that subsists, or is to subsist, for the benefit of the dwelling is also taken to be part of the dwelling. This applies to an interest in land which is not attached to the dwelling and its garden or grounds. 
 
 
 
 
 Examples 
 
 
   
 A garage sold with the dwelling but that’s physically separate from that dwelling. A person purchasing a flat with an allocated parking space or a house with a garage in a block of garages from the same person will have entered into a residential purchase. Where grounds have been split by a public highway.

 However, where the land had ceased to subsist for the benefit of the dwelling at the effective date of the transaction, this will not be a residential transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A garage that belonged to a dwelling was sold several years ago to a separate buyer. That buyer owned several garages, but none of the dwellings to which the garages used to belong. When the block of garages is sold, this will be a non-residential transaction.

 Rights of way, easements and fencing The fencing off of a part of a garden or grounds or a public footpath crossing garden and grounds does not change the nature of that land unless the dwelling owners no longer had rights of use or access to it. The acquisition or removal of rights of way and easements will also be the acquisition of residential land if the right subsists for the benefit of a dwelling. Therefore, payments made to acquire or remove a right of way or easement that benefits a building that’s used or is suitable for use as a dwelling will be liable to the residential rates of LTT.

432,432,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Interpretation provisions,LTTA/1120 Meaning of land," (section 75) ‘Land’ includes: buildings and structures, and land covered by water LTT can only be charged on “land in Wales”. Land in Wales does not include land below the low water mark. It does however include jetties, piers and similar structures where one end is attached to land in Wales. It also includes land underwater above the low water mark, for example lakes and rivers. A caravan, including static caravans and mobile homes, is generally a movable asset. They are generally not considered to be property or land. If the caravan can be moved easily, without damaging the land, it is likely that it would not be subject to LTT. However, depending on the facts, it may be that LTT would be due in relation to a purchase or lease of the land on which the static caravan sits. If, in buying the static caravan, the taxpayer also enters into a lease of a piece of land, or buys the piece of land, those transactions may be subject to LTT. If the right to use the land for the static caravan is agreed through a licence, it is unlikely that this would be subject to LTT. These considerations also apply to houseboats. If the boat can be easily removed from its moorings, without damaging the land, it is likely that it would not be subject to LTT. If the boat is permanently attached to the land, potentially through another structure, it may be subject to LTT. LTT may apply to the mooring agreement, as with static caravans and mobile homes, if the agreement is considered a lease, rather than a licence. If the agreement allows the taxpayer exclusive access to a berth for a term of years, this is likely to be a lease. If the boat can be easily moved to another berth, or if the berth can be accessed without prior notice, this is likely to be a licence.

437,437,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Calculating Land Transaction Tax,LTTA/3020 Tax chargeable," (section 27) 
 For transactions that are not linked to other land transactions subject to LTT the liability is established in the following manner: 
 
 Step 1 – for each tax band applicable multiply so much of the chargeable consideration that falls within that band by the percentage rate applicable to that band 
 Step 2 – calculate the sum of the various amounts established under step 1. The total is the amount of tax chargeable for the land transaction 
 
 A  calculator is provided by the WRA(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-calculator)  that a taxpayer can use to calculate their liability. Please note that the calculator will establish the liability based on the information given. Where a number of rules require different methods of calculation, the calculator cannot be used.

 Step 1 – calculate the tax chargeable on the total consideration given for all the linked transactions. This means treating the linked transactions as though they were a single transaction 
 Step 2 – establish the fraction that relates to the current transaction. This is done by dividing the chargeable consideration for that transaction by the total consideration for all the linked transactions 
 Step 3 – multiply the tax chargeable that was established under step 1 by the fraction established at step 2. 
 
 The ‘total consideration’ is the total of all the consideration paid for all of the linked transactions.  
 It is possible that a return or further return will be needed in relation to the earlier linked transactions as the calculation is applied to each linked transaction (including those that have already been subject to tax), each time there is a further linked transaction. 
 Example 2 (below) explains how to calculate linked transactions where there has been a change in rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) between the transactions. The example uses the non-residential rates, however the same methodology should be followed for all other sets of rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd buys a non-residential property costing £500,000 on 1 June 2018. It is followed by 2 other linked transactions, both of non-residential property. The second transaction has an effective date of 1 August 2020 with consideration given of £350,000, and the third has an effective date of 1 November 2020 with consideration given of £1,100,000. For the purposes of this example there are no changes to the tax rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) during this period. There have not been any non-residential rate changes during this period. 
 Transaction 1 
 The first transaction results in a liability to tax of £13,500. A return for this transaction, and payment of the tax, must be made by 1 July 2018. 
 Transaction 2 
 As the first and second transactions are linked, the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated below) are applied to both transactions. The total consideration is £850,000 (transaction 1 - £500,000 + transaction 2 - £350,000) and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £31,000 (step 1). The fraction for the second transaction is 7/17 (350,000/850,000) and the fraction for the first transaction is 10/17 (500,000/850,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is therefore £12,764.71 (£31,000 x 7/17). The tax due for the first transaction is £18,235.29 (step 3). A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax (£12,764.70), for the second transaction by 31 August 2020. A Ltd must also make a further return for the first transaction, and pay the tax, less any tax already paid, by 31 August 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £18,235.29, less £13,500 that has already been paid, so only £4,735.29 needs to be paid on the further return in respect of the first transaction. 
 Transaction 3 
 The third transaction is linked to transactions 1 and 2, and so the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated below) are applied to each of the transactions again. The total consideration for all 3 transactions is £1,950,000 (transaction 1 - £500,000 + transaction 2 - £350,000 + transaction 3 - £1,100,000), and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £95,500 (step 1). The fraction for the third transaction is 22/39 (1,100,000/1,950,000), (500,000/1,950,000) and 10/39 for the second transaction (500,000/1,950,000), and 7/39 for the first transaction (350,000/1,950,000) (step 2). The tax due for the third transaction is £53,871.79 (£95,500 x 22/39), for the second transaction is £24,487.17 (£95,500 x 10/39), and for the first transaction is £17,141.02 (£95,500 x 7/39). 
 A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax, for the third transaction by 1 December 2020. A Ltd must also make 2 further returns for the first and second transactions. In relation to the first transaction A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 1 December 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £24,487.18, however, as £18,235.29 (£13,500 + £4,735.29) has already been paid only £6,251.89 needs to be paid. A Ltd must also make a return for the second transaction. A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 1 December 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £17,141.03, however, as £12,764.71 has already been paid only £4,376.32 needs to be paid.

 Transaction 1 
 The first transaction does not result in a tax liability. A return is still required for this transaction. It must be made by 1 December 2020. 
 Transaction 2 
 As the first and second transactions are linked, the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated above) are applied to both transactions. 
 The total consideration is £600,000 (transaction 1 - £100,000 + transaction 2 - £500,000) and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £18,500 (step 1). 
 The fraction for the second transaction is 5/6 (500,000/600,000) and the fraction for the first transaction is 1/6 (100,000/600,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is therefore £15,416.67 (£18,500 x 5/6). The tax due for the first transaction is £3,083.33 (step 3). A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax (£15,416.67), for the second transaction by 31 December 2020. A Ltd must also make a further return for the first transaction, and pay the tax of £3083.33 by 31 December 2021. 
 Transaction 3 
 The third transaction is linked to transactions 1 and 2, and so the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated below) are applied to each of the transactions again. However, the rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) have changed in between transaction 2 and transaction 3. 
 The total consideration for all 3 transactions is £1,300,000 (transaction 1 - £100,000 + transaction 2 - £500,000 + transaction 3 - £700,000), and the tax liability based on the total consideration at “new rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands)” is £55,750 (step 1). 
 The fraction for the third transaction is 7/13 (700,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the third transaction is £30,019.23 (£55,750 x 7/13). (step 3) 
 To calculate any additional tax required for transactions 1 & 2 B Ltd will need to calculate the total consideration (£1,300,000) using the “old rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands)”. This is £56,500. (step 1) 
 The fraction for the second transaction is 5/13 (500,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is £21,730.77 (£56,500 x 5/13). (step 3) 
 The fraction for the first transaction is 1/13 (100,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the first transaction is £4,346.15 (£56,500 x 1/13). (step 3) 
 B Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax, for the third transaction by 31 January 2021. A Ltd must also make 2 further returns for the first and second transactions. In relation to the first transaction A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 31 January 2021. The tax due on that transaction is now £4,346.15, however, as £3,083.33 has already been paid only £1,262.82 needs to be paid. B Ltd must also make a further return for the second transaction. The tax due on that transaction is now £21,730.77, however, as £15,416.67 has already been paid only £6,314.10 needs to be paid. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 A Ltd buys a non-residential property costing £500,000 on 1 June 2018. It is followed by 2 other linked transactions, both of non-residential property. The second transaction has an effective date of 1 August 2020 with consideration given of £350,000, and the third has an effective date of 1 November 2020 with consideration given of £1,100,000. For the purposes of this example there are no changes to the tax rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) during this period. There have not been any non-residential rate changes during this period. 
 Transaction 1 
 The first transaction results in a liability to tax of £13,500. A return for this transaction, and payment of the tax, must be made by 1 July 2018. 
 Transaction 2 
 As the first and second transactions are linked, the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated below) are applied to both transactions. The total consideration is £850,000 (transaction 1 - £500,000 + transaction 2 - £350,000) and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £31,000 (step 1). The fraction for the second transaction is 7/17 (350,000/850,000) and the fraction for the first transaction is 10/17 (500,000/850,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is therefore £12,764.71 (£31,000 x 7/17). The tax due for the first transaction is £18,235.29 (step 3). A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax (£12,764.70), for the second transaction by 31 August 2020. A Ltd must also make a further return for the first transaction, and pay the tax, less any tax already paid, by 31 August 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £18,235.29, less £13,500 that has already been paid, so only £4,735.29 needs to be paid on the further return in respect of the first transaction. 
 Transaction 3 
 The third transaction is linked to transactions 1 and 2, and so the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated below) are applied to each of the transactions again. The total consideration for all 3 transactions is £1,950,000 (transaction 1 - £500,000 + transaction 2 - £350,000 + transaction 3 - £1,100,000), and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £95,500 (step 1). The fraction for the third transaction is 22/39 (1,100,000/1,950,000), (500,000/1,950,000) and 10/39 for the second transaction (500,000/1,950,000), and 7/39 for the first transaction (350,000/1,950,000) (step 2). The tax due for the third transaction is £53,871.79 (£95,500 x 22/39), for the second transaction is £24,487.17 (£95,500 x 10/39), and for the first transaction is £17,141.02 (£95,500 x 7/39). 
 A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax, for the third transaction by 1 December 2020. A Ltd must also make 2 further returns for the first and second transactions. In relation to the first transaction A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 1 December 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £24,487.18, however, as £18,235.29 (£13,500 + £4,735.29) has already been paid only £6,251.89 needs to be paid. A Ltd must also make a return for the second transaction. A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 1 December 2020. The tax due on that transaction is now £17,141.03, however, as £12,764.71 has already been paid only £4,376.32 needs to be paid.

 The fraction for the third transaction is 7/13 (700,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the third transaction is £30,019.23 (£55,750 x 7/13). (step 3) 
 To calculate any additional tax required for transactions 1 & 2 B Ltd will need to calculate the total consideration (£1,300,000) using the “old rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands)”. This is £56,500. (step 1) 
 The fraction for the second transaction is 5/13 (500,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is £21,730.77 (£56,500 x 5/13). (step 3) 
 The fraction for the first transaction is 1/13 (100,000/1,300,000) (step 2). The tax due for the first transaction is £4,346.15 (£56,500 x 1/13). (step 3) 
 B Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax, for the third transaction by 31 January 2021. A Ltd must also make 2 further returns for the first and second transactions. In relation to the first transaction A Ltd must make a return and pay the tax, by 31 January 2021. The tax due on that transaction is now £4,346.15, however, as £3,083.33 has already been paid only £1,262.82 needs to be paid. B Ltd must also make a further return for the second transaction. The tax due on that transaction is now £21,730.77, however, as £15,416.67 has already been paid only £6,314.10 needs to be paid.

 Transaction 1 
 The first transaction does not result in a tax liability. A return is still required for this transaction. It must be made by 1 December 2020. 
 Transaction 2 
 As the first and second transactions are linked, the linked transaction calculation rules (as illustrated above) are applied to both transactions. 
 The total consideration is £600,000 (transaction 1 - £100,000 + transaction 2 - £500,000) and the tax liability based on the total consideration is £18,500 (step 1). 
 The fraction for the second transaction is 5/6 (500,000/600,000) and the fraction for the first transaction is 1/6 (100,000/600,000) (step 2). The tax due for the second transaction is therefore £15,416.67 (£18,500 x 5/6). The tax due for the first transaction is £3,083.33 (step 3). A Ltd must send in a return, and pay the tax (£15,416.67), for the second transaction by 31 December 2020. A Ltd must also make a further return for the first transaction, and pay the tax of £3083.33 by 31 December 2021.

They came into force on 10 October 2022. 
 1. Application of new rates 
 Regulation 3 
 Main residential rates transactions with an effective date on or after 10 October 2022 shall be subject to the main residential rates in table 1 of the Land Transaction Tax (Tax Bands and Tax Rates) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (‘the 2022 Regulations’). 
 See the  rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands)  page for the current and previous rates of LTT. 
 2. Transitional provisions 
 Regulation 4 
 The 2022 Regulations will not have effect (and the rates before 10 October 2022 will apply) on any transaction where: 
 
 exchange of contracts has taken place and the transaction is completed before 10 October 2022 
 exchange of contracts has taken place before 10 October 2022 but the transaction is not completed until on or after 10 October 2022 and an election is made to tax the transaction at the rates effective before 10 October 2022 (as explained below) 
 
 2.1 Election to apply transitional provisions 
 Regulation 6 
 Where under Regulation 4 the main residential rates before 10 October 2022 may apply, it’s possible under Regulation 6 to elect for these rates to apply. Where no election is made, the main residential rates effective from 10 October 2022 will apply. 
 The election may be made in 2 circumstances. 
 
 Where contracts were exchanged before 10 October 2022 and the contract was substantially performed before that date (refer to  LTTA/2150 for further information on substantial performance(/particular-transactions-technical-guidance#4931) ). 
 Where contracts were exchanged before 10 October 2022, and the contract is completed on or after that date. This election may be made provided there is no event on or after 10 October 2022, of the kind listed at Regulation 5, which results in the effect of the contract on completion being different from the effect of the contract when first entered into. 
 
 This election under Regulation 6 must be made: 
 
 in a Land Transaction Tax (LTT) return, or 
 in an amendment to such a return 
 
 An election may only be made where it won’t result in more tax being charged as a result of using the rates before 10 October 2022. 
 Further guidance on the completion of the LTT return and the calculation of LTT is available in the  Land Transaction Tax return guidance(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-return-guidance-tax-calculation-html) . 
 2.2 Exceptions to transitional provisions 
 Regulation 5 
 Transactions where contracts were exchanged before 10 October 2022 but completed on or after that date, will be subject to the main residential rates in force from 10 October 2022 if any of the following apply: 
 
 there's any variation of the contract, or assignment of rights under the contract, on or after 10 October 2022 
 the transaction is effected in consequence of the exercise on or after that date of any option, right of pre-emption or similar right 
 on or after that date there’s an assignment, subsale or other transaction relating to the whole or part of the subject-matter of the contract as a result of which a person other than the purchaser under the contract becomes entitled to call for a transfer

441,441,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Calculating Land Transaction Tax,LTTA/3050 Changes to tax bands and tax rates – regulations ceasing to have effect," (section 26) 
 In the event that the regulations cease to have effect because the National Assembly for Wales did not vote on the regulations, or voted to reject them, the regulations are to be treated as ‘rejected regulations’. The rejected regulations will have been in force for a period known as the ‘interim period’. The interim period is the period from the date that the rejected regulations came into force and ending on the date the regulations cease to have effect. 
 If the effective date of a transaction falls within the interim period the rates specified by the rejected regulations apply to the transaction. There are 3 exclusions from that rule. If one of the exclusions applies, the rates and bands(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-rates-and-bands) that apply are those that would have been in force had the rejected regulations not been made. 
 Exclusion 1 
 If the buyer is required to make a return that has a filing date that is within the interim period but fails to make that return before the end date of the interim period. 
 Exclusion 2 
 If the buyer is required to make a first return for a chargeable transaction under one of the following situations: 
 
 a duty to make a return where a contingency ceases or consideration is ascertained 
 a return as a result of a later linked transaction 
 a return as a result of a lease continuing after a fixed term or for an indefinite term 
 a return required as a result of a lease reconsideration date 
 
 Exclusion 3 
 If the buyer makes a claim to repayment under S63A TCMA, that claim is treated as an amendment to the return, and a further return is required due to: 
 
 one of the reasons in exclusion 2 
 a further return required as a result of a relief being withdrawn

443,443,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Calculating Land Transaction Tax,LTTA/3070 Reliefs," (section 30) 
 Reliefs available are either full reliefs resulting in all tax payable on the transaction being relieved, or partial relief where some of the consideration given is not relieved including some where the method of calculation is varied. In some cases, such as charities relief, the relief can be either a full relief or a partial relief. It is important when claiming relief that the taxpayer selects the correct relief, and if that relief can be full or partial that the correct option is selected. 
 All reliefs, with the exception of the visiting forces and international military headquarters relief, must be claimed in the first return made in relation to that transaction or an amendment to that return. Failure to comply with the time limits for making an amendment to the first return will result in the taxpayer not being able to make a claim to apply the relief.  
 In relation to visiting forces and international military headquarters relief, the claim may be made in the return for that land transaction, or an amendment to that return, or by making a claim for repayment of overpaid tax. The time limit for making such a claim does apply to the making of that claim for repayment. 
 The reliefs are contained in schedules 9 to 22 of the LTTA and provide for: 
 
 Sale and leaseback relief 
 Alternative property finance relief 
 Relief for alternative finance bonds 
 Relief for incorporation of limited liability partnership 
 Relief for Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings

444,444,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Calculating Land Transaction Tax,LTTA/3080 Reliefs: anti-avoidance – the reliefs targeted anti-avoidance rule (‘the reliefs TAAR’)," (section 31) 
 Any claim to a relief is subject to a targeted anti-avoidance rule (‘TAAR’). The TAAR operates so that a taxpayer cannot claim relief where the transaction is, or is part of, a ‘tax avoidance arrangement’. A tax avoidance arrangement is defined as an arrangement where the obtaining of a ‘tax advantage’ by any person was the main or one of the main purposes of the arrangement, and the arrangement lacks a genuine economic or commercial main purpose (other than the obtaining of a tax advantage). 
 ‘Arrangements’ has been defined so that it includes any transaction, scheme, agreement, understanding, promise or any series of such arrangements. 
 A ‘tax advantage’ is defined widely to mean: 
 
 the claiming of a relief or an increased relief from tax 
 the repayment of or an increased repayment of tax 
 the avoidance or the reduction of a charge to tax, and 
 the deferral of a payment of tax or the advancement of a repayment of tax 
 
 The TAAR is intended to apply to cases where relief is claimed in circumstances where it is not the intention of the National Assembly for Wales that relief should be given. Therefore, in situations where a transaction is structured in a manner that complies with generally prevailing practice and the taxpayer claims relief as intended then that claim will not fall within the scope of this anti-avoidance rule. However, where additional arrangements or steps are entered into solely to create a situation in which the conditions for claim to relief are met then the claim will fall within these provisions and should not be made. 
 Whether an arrangement has a genuine economic or commercial main purpose will, ultimately, depend on the facts of the transaction. For example, the TAAR should not prohibit a claim to relief by a charity where it acquires a property for charitable purposes (for example housing people who meet the charity’s charitable purposes) as, whilst there may not be a commercial reason to the acquisition, there is an economic purpose as the charity has exchanged cash for a physical asset – the property – with which to further its charitable purposes. 
 ‘Tax’ for the purposes this section is wider than just LTT, and includes some taxes imposed at a UK level as well (specifically income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty land tax, stamp duty reserve tax or stamp duty). This will ensure that where a Welsh land transaction is entered into (and for which relief would otherwise be allowable) relief from LTT cannot be claimed if the land transaction forms part of arrangements to avoid that other tax, or taxes. Prohibiting the claim for relief from LTT in these circumstances is without prejudice to any action HMRC might take to recover the non-devolved tax that has been avoided. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Sale and leaseback relief and group relief: TAAR does not apply. 
 Sale and leaseback relief provides for no LTT to be charged on any premium payable or on the rent payable under the lease granted to the seller by the buyer. The purpose of the relief is so that no LTT charge arises on what is essentially a financing transaction – the seller obtains a lump sum and pays ’interest’ in the form of rent to the buyer. 
 However, once the lease expires, the buyer will have acquired an unencumbered freehold or leasehold interest and so it is appropriate for LTT to remain due on the purchase price paid to the seller. 
 One of the requirements of sale and leaseback relief is that the seller is also the person who is granted the lease (see paragraph 2(b) of Schedule 9 LTTA). 
 A Ltd wishes to enter into a sale and leaseback arrangement with an unconnected third party (Y Ltd) but wants the lease to be granted to A Ltd’s subsidiary (B Ltd). The facts are such that there are sound commercial reasons for B Ltd to own the lease rather than A Ltd. 
 If A Ltd were to sell the property to Y Ltd and require Y Ltd to grant the lease to B Ltd the conditions for sale and leaseback relief would not have been met as the lease was not granted to the seller in the sale leg of the arrangements. 
 A Ltd could either: 
 
 first assign or transfer the property to B Ltd; B Ltd would issue a debenture to A Ltd, as the consideration for that transfer; B Ltd would then sell the property to Y Ltd; Y Ltd would grant the lease back to B Ltd; and in due course B Ltd satisfies the debenture either out of its own funds or from the cash paid by Y Ltd to B Ltd, or  
 enter into the sale and leaseback in the normal way so that the lease is granted by Y Ltd to A Ltd; and then A Ltd immediately transfers or assigns the lease to B Ltd 
 
 For either arrangements the consideration will be based on the market value of the property transferred from A Ltd to B Ltd as the transaction is between connected parties. 
 In first option B Ltd will claim group relief so that no LTT is paid on the assignment or transfer of the property to it from A Ltd and B Ltd will claim sale and leaseback relief (so that Y Ltd pays LTT on the purchase price but B Ltd does not pay LTT on the premium or rent due under the leaseback). 
 In the second option A Ltd will claim sale and leaseback relief as the conditions are satisfied and B Ltd will claim group relief on the assignment so that no LTT would be payable on any consideration B Ltd paid (or was treated as paying by section 22 LTTA) to A Ltd. Y Ltd will still pay on the consideration that it gives for the sale leg of the sale and leaseback arrangement. 
 Looking at the arrangements as a whole, the property was owned by A Ltd, but the leaseback from Y Ltd is to B Ltd. However, whilst those transactions would have resulted in the claim to relief not being possible, and that arrangements have been made to ensure that relief can be obtained, those arrangements do not amount to tax avoidance arrangements. This is because the arrangements have genuine economic or commercial substance. 
 Group relief, within limits, is intended to prevent a charge to LTT arising where an asset remains within a group. Therefore, the transfer of the property before the sale and leaseback, or assignment of the lease following the leaseback, would be consistent with the principles and policy behind the legislation – the asset remains in the group, and tax is paid on the asset leaving the group. In a sale and leaseback scenario an amount of LTT should be payable by the buyer (Y Ltd) but the leaseback element is relieved from charge. Likewise, group relief can be claimed when the relevant conditions are met on a transfer between group companies. In this case the single tax liability arising on the buyer (Y Ltd) remains and neither A Ltd nor B Ltd have gained a tax advantage that is not intended to be available to them. 
 On the basis of the facts, there is no indication that any of the steps are wholly or mainly to gain a tax advantage. The sequence of transactions are part of the normal financing arrangements and the group needs to have the asset held by B Ltd rather than A Ltd is, in this case, for genuine commercial reasons. The group has combined 2 reliefs in a legitimate manner that results in the tax charges intended.

 Group relief: TAAR does not apply 
 Examples of arrangements or transactions that will, on the bare facts set out not prohibit a claim to relief. The examples also assume that the transactions described do not form part of any larger scheme or arrangement which might have tax consequences: 
 
 the transfer of a property to a group company having in mind the possibility that shares in that company might be sold more than 3 years after the date of transfer (a clawback of the relief may arise in the event of the share sale) 
 the transfer of a property to a group company prior to the sale of shares in the transferor company, in order that the property remain in the group and does not pass to the purchaser of the shares

 However, once the lease expires, the buyer will have acquired an unencumbered freehold or leasehold interest and so it is appropriate for LTT to remain due on the purchase price paid to the seller. 
 One of the requirements of sale and leaseback relief is that the seller is also the person who is granted the lease (see paragraph 2(b) of Schedule 9 LTTA). 
 A Ltd wishes to enter into a sale and leaseback arrangement with an unconnected third party (Y Ltd) but wants the lease to be granted to A Ltd’s subsidiary (B Ltd). The facts are such that there are sound commercial reasons for B Ltd to own the lease rather than A Ltd. 
 If A Ltd were to sell the property to Y Ltd and require Y Ltd to grant the lease to B Ltd the conditions for sale and leaseback relief would not have been met as the lease was not granted to the seller in the sale leg of the arrangements. 
 A Ltd could either: 
 
 first assign or transfer the property to B Ltd; B Ltd would issue a debenture to A Ltd, as the consideration for that transfer; B Ltd would then sell the property to Y Ltd; Y Ltd would grant the lease back to B Ltd; and in due course B Ltd satisfies the debenture either out of its own funds or from the cash paid by Y Ltd to B Ltd, or  
 enter into the sale and leaseback in the normal way so that the lease is granted by Y Ltd to A Ltd; and then A Ltd immediately transfers or assigns the lease to B Ltd 
 
 For either arrangements the consideration will be based on the market value of the property transferred from A Ltd to B Ltd as the transaction is between connected parties. 
 In first option B Ltd will claim group relief so that no LTT is paid on the assignment or transfer of the property to it from A Ltd and B Ltd will claim sale and leaseback relief (so that Y Ltd pays LTT on the purchase price but B Ltd does not pay LTT on the premium or rent due under the leaseback). 
 In the second option A Ltd will claim sale and leaseback relief as the conditions are satisfied and B Ltd will claim group relief on the assignment so that no LTT would be payable on any consideration B Ltd paid (or was treated as paying by section 22 LTTA) to A Ltd. Y Ltd will still pay on the consideration that it gives for the sale leg of the sale and leaseback arrangement. 
 Looking at the arrangements as a whole, the property was owned by A Ltd, but the leaseback from Y Ltd is to B Ltd. However, whilst those transactions would have resulted in the claim to relief not being possible, and that arrangements have been made to ensure that relief can be obtained, those arrangements do not amount to tax avoidance arrangements. This is because the arrangements have genuine economic or commercial substance. 
 Group relief, within limits, is intended to prevent a charge to LTT arising where an asset remains within a group. Therefore, the transfer of the property before the sale and leaseback, or assignment of the lease following the leaseback, would be consistent with the principles and policy behind the legislation – the asset remains in the group, and tax is paid on the asset leaving the group. In a sale and leaseback scenario an amount of LTT should be payable by the buyer (Y Ltd) but the leaseback element is relieved from charge. Likewise, group relief can be claimed when the relevant conditions are met on a transfer between group companies. In this case the single tax liability arising on the buyer (Y Ltd) remains and neither A Ltd nor B Ltd have gained a tax advantage that is not intended to be available to them. 
 On the basis of the facts, there is no indication that any of the steps are wholly or mainly to gain a tax advantage. The sequence of transactions are part of the normal financing arrangements and the group needs to have the asset held by B Ltd rather than A Ltd is, in this case, for genuine commercial reasons. The group has combined 2 reliefs in a legitimate manner that results in the tax charges intended.

445,445,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Technical guidance / Calculating Land Transaction Tax,LTTA/3090 The TAAR and other anti-avoidance rules," In addition to the TAAR, the devolved taxes legislation contains other anti-avoidance provisions, the most significant of which being the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (‘GAAR’). 
 The GAAR is designed to counteract tax advantages which arise as a result of the artificial tax avoidance arrangements that have been used by the taxpayer. 
 The GAAR is independent of the other anti-avoidance rules, and it may be used to challenge an artificial arrangement which was itself contrived to exploit a defect, or perceived defect, in the other anti-avoidance rules. 
 Whilst multiple arguments based on other areas of the devolved tax legislation may be possible, the WRA can choose to use only a GAAR challenge. A taxpayer cannot object to the use of the GAAR simply because other means available to the WRA to challenge the artificial arrangement have not been used. 
 Full guidance on the GAAR is available at  TCMA/8000(https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-general-anti-avoidance-rule-technical-guidance) .

 Relief from LTT is available where a qualifying charity, or a charitable trust, buys an interest in land, subject to certain conditions. Partial charities relief is also available where a qualifying charity buys property with a person who is not a charity. 
 There are also rules that provide for charities relief to be clawed back. This will occur if, within three years of the transaction, the qualifying charity ceases to be a qualifying charity or uses the property for purposes other than charitable ones. The same claw back rules and conditions also apply to charitable trusts. The relief is only withdrawn if the qualifying charity, or charitable trust, still owns the land at the time of the disqualifying event. However, if a qualifying charity or charitable trust disposes of land, which has been the subject of a claim to relief, within 3 years there is no clawback. 
 Partial relief available to both charities and charitable trusts where the conditions to claim full relief are not met, for example where the property is not wholly used for charitable purposes or where the buyers include both qualifying charities and a person who is not a charity.

 A ‘charity’ for the purposes of LTT draws on the UK definitions provided in Part 1 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2010. Generally, a charity is one that is: 
 
 a charity established and recognised as such in Wales, England, Scotland or Northern Ireland 
 a charity established and recognised as such in an EU member state, or 
 a charity established and recognised as such in Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein 
 
 Some charities, including churches, universities and colleges, either cannot register, or are not required to register, with the Charity Commissioners in England and Wales. They are, however, still charities. 
 A ‘disqualifying event’ occurs where a charity, which was a buyer in a land transaction that was the subject of a claim to charities relief, ceases to be established for charitable purposes, or the whole or part of the subject matter of the transaction, or any interest derived from it, ceases to be used or held for purposes that are not qualifying charitable purposes.  
 A ‘qualifying charity’ is one that intends to hold the whole of the subject matter of the transaction for qualifying charitable purposes and the charity is the only buyer. A charity is also a qualifying charity if it is one of a number of buyers, one or more of whom are not charities if the charity intends to hold the whole of its interest in the property for qualifying charitable purposes. Where a charity does not intend to hold the whole of the subject matter or the whole of its share in the subject matter for charitable purposes, the charity may be able to make a claim to partial charities relief. In these cases the legislation refers to the charity as ‘not a qualifying charity’. 
 A ‘qualifying charitable purpose’ is one that: 
 
 furthers the purposes of the charity (or another charity), or 
 is an investment the profits or gains of which are used for the charitable purposes of the charity 
 
 A charitable purpose is defined in section 2 of the Charities Act 2011.

450,450,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Charities relief,LTTA/7083 Circumstances when relief is withdrawn," (paragraph 4)  
 If within 3 years of the transaction for which charities relief was claimed (the relieved transaction), a disqualifying event occurs, then the relief, or an appropriate proportion of it, is withdrawn. The same applies if a disqualifying event occurs later but in pursuance of or in connection with arrangements made before the end of that period. 
 The qualifying charity must hold the chargeable interest at the time of the disqualifying event, or an interest derived from it, for relief to be withdrawn. This ensures that if the charity held the chargeable interest for qualifying charitable purposes the sale of that property within 3 years of its acquisition will not result in the relief being clawed back. 
 Where the conditions for the relief to be clawed back are met, then the relief granted, or an appropriate proportion of the relief, is withdrawn and LTT is chargeable. A taxpayer will need to make a further return to pay the LTT due. 
 The amount chargeable is the LTT which would have been chargeable in respect of the relieved transaction if charities relief had not been claimed or, as the case may be, an appropriate proportion of that LTT. 
 An appropriate proportion is calculated having regard to: 
 
 what was acquired in the relieved transaction and is still held by the qualifying charity for charitable purposes, and 
 what is being used or held for purposes that do not meet the conditions of qualifying charitable purposes 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Qualifying Charity C (‘QCC’) has as its charitable purpose, the alleviation of poverty. QCC buys a shop in order to let it to its trading arm. After 2 years the charity loses its charitable status. It is therefore no longer a qualifying charity. Whilst the acquisition of the shop would qualify for charities relief, once QCC is no longer a qualifying charity there is a disqualifying event and the relief must be withdrawn. The further return must be sent in within 30 days following the date that the disqualifying event occurred, that is the date that QCC lost its charitable status.

451,451,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Charities relief,LTTA/7084 Charity is a qualifying charity: charity to hold the greater part of the land for charitable purposes," (paragraph 5) 
 Where a charity or charitable trust is unable to claim relief on a land transaction: 
 
 because it does not intend to hold the whole of the land for qualifying charitable purposes 
 but it does intend to hold the greater part for such purposes 
 
 then the whole of the transaction can be relieved. Relief is provided in these circumstances as the charity is treated as if it were a qualifying charity. 
 The greater part means more than 50% of the monetary value of the property acquired in the transaction. This is to be valued on a just and reasonable basis. 
 If the charity disposes of part of that land or holds part of it for use other than for qualifying charitable purposes, a relevant portion of the relief will be clawed back and the charity is required to make a further return within 30 days following the date of the disposal or point at which the land is held for use other than for qualifying charitable purposes. 
 This ensures that the relief granted is in proportion to the share of the land retained and held by the charity in furtherance of its charitable aims. 
 The meaning of a disqualifying event, in these circumstances, therefore includes any transfer by the charity of: 
 
 a major interest in the whole or any part of the subject matter of the relieved transaction, or 
 any grant of a lease by the charity for a premium and rent of less than £1,000 per annum of the whole or part of the subject matter of the relieved transaction 
 
 In both cases the date of the disqualifying event is the effective date of the relieved transaction. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 The greater part relates to the monetary value of the part of the land disposed rather than the surface area. 
 Charity A (‘CA’) buys a 5 floor office block and intends to dispose of the top 3 floors following its acquisition. This intention exists at the time of acquisition. The ground and first floors are of greater value, even though the floors are all of equal size. The ground and first floors represent 55% of the total monetary value of the block with the remaining upper three floors representing 45%. 
 The charity would qualify for relief as it intended to hold the greater part, by value, of the land for qualifying charitable purposes. If this disposal occurs on the date of the relieved transaction then the return for that transaction must be made reflecting the fact that partial relief only is available for the transaction. Otherwise, when that disposal occurs there will be a need for a further return to be made to claw back the relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 When there is a clawback, it is only in respect of the proportion that has been disposed of. 
 Charity B (‘CB’) buys a housing development with 10 equal residential units for a total of £1m with the intention to dispose of 3 of these units on the open market as soon as the acquisition has been made. 
 The charity would initially gain full LTT charity relief on the whole £1m purchase price. CB finds a single buyer for the 3 dwellings it wishes to dispose of.  
 When the charity disposes of the 3 units, a claw back of relief on the £300,000 apportioned value of the 3 units is made. 
 The clawback will be taxed at the rate appropriate to the whole initial consideration – the charity cannot claim multiple dwellings relief on the further return. As a result the LTT payable on the transaction absent the charities relief would be £37,750 (using the rates and bands in force at 22 December 2020 – (£225,000 at 0% = £0) + (£25,000 at 1% = £250) + (£750,000 at 5% = £37,500)) as the transaction can be treated as a non-residential transaction. The tax to be clawed back is therefore a percentage of the tax on the property initially acquired and the property disposed of. In this case that would be 300,000/1,000,000 x £37,500 = £11,250.

452,452,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Charities relief,LTTA/7085 Joint purchase by qualifying charity and another person; partial relief," (paragraph 6) 
 Where there are: 
 
 2 or more buyers in a land transaction 
 the subject matter of that transaction is to be held as tenant in common, and 
 one of the buyers is a qualifying charity and one of the buyers is a person who is not a qualifying charity 
 
 claims to partial relief on that acquisition are possible. 
 The LTT that would otherwise be chargeable on the land transaction is reduced by the relevant proportion of that amount. The relevant proportion is, in relation to the qualifying charity, the lower of: 
 
 the proportion of the subject matter of the land transaction that is acquired by all the qualifying charities that are buyers under the transaction, this is known as P1, and 
 the proportion of the chargeable consideration that is given by the qualifying charities under the transaction. This is known as P2 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A qualifying charity and 2 persons who are not charities or charitable trusts purchase a supermarket building as an investment property to generate income. The qualifying charity will use its proportion of the income to further its charitable purposes. The building costs £10,000,000 and the property will be owned equally and the property is funded equally. In this case P1 and P2 are the same proportion, with the charity acquiring a 1/3 interest in the building and funding 1/3 of the cost. 
 The LTT, absent any claim to relief, due (based on the LTT rates in force on 1 April 2018) is £578,500. The partial charities relief proportion applied to that LTT is 1/3. Therefore relief of £192,834 may be claimed, leaving £385,666 to be paid. All the buyers, including the charity, are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the tax.

453,453,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Charities relief,LTTA/7086 Withdrawal of partial charities relief," (paragraph 7) 
 In the event that a land transaction which was relieved under the partial charities relief rules becomes subject to a disqualifying event in relation to the qualifying charity, then the relief or an appropriate proportion of it, is withdrawn and tax will, accordingly, become chargeable. 
 The disqualifying event must occur within 3 years of the relieved transaction, that is, the transaction for which partial charities relief was claimed, or in carrying out, or in connection with, an arrangement entered into within that 3 year period a disqualifying event occurs the partial relief, or an appropriate proportion of it is withdrawn. 
 The qualifying charity must hold the chargeable interest at the time of the disqualifying event, or an interest derived from it, for relief to be withdrawn. This ensures that if the charity held the chargeable interest for qualifying charitable purposes the sale of that property within three years of its acquisition will not result in the relief being clawed back. 
 In transactions where there is a single qualifying charity involved in the transaction a disqualifying event will result in the total amount of the partial relief being withdrawn. 
 However, where there is more than one qualifying charity purchasing the property, the proportion of the relief to be withdrawn is dependent upon whether the P1 or P2 proportion was used to calculate the amount of partial relief in on the acquisition of the property. The formula for calculating the relief to be withdrawn is either: 
 p1 ÷ P1 x amount of partial relief claimed 
 or 
 p2 ÷ P2 x amount of partial relief claimed 
 In the first case p1 represents the proportion of the subject matter that was acquired by the charity that has triggered the disqualifying event and P1 represents the proportion of the subject matter acquired by all of the qualifying charities. 
 In the 2nd case p2 is the proportion of the chargeable consideration for the transaction given by the charity that triggered the disqualifying event and P2 represents the proportion of the chargeable consideration given by all of the qualifying charities. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 2 qualifying charities and 2 persons who are not charities or charitable trusts purchase a building as an investment property to generate income. The qualifying charities will both use their proportion of the income to further their respective charitable purposes. The building costs £10,000,000 and the property will be owned equally and the property is funded equally. In this case P1 and P2 are the same proportion, with each charity acquiring a 1/4 interest in the building and funding 1/4 of the cost. 
 The LTT, absent any claim to relief, due (based on the LTT rates in force on 22 December 2020) is £577,750. The partial charities relief proportion applied to that LTT is one half (i.e. the 2 charities interests are aggregated for the purposes of establishing the partial relief. Therefore relief of £288,875 may be claimed, leaving £288,875 to be paid. All the buyers, including the charities, are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the tax. 
 Within 3 years of the transaction one of the qualifying charities triggers a disqualifying event. The amount of the partial relief that is withdrawn is using the p1/P1 formula: 
 0.25 ÷ 0.50 x 288,875 = £144,437.50 
 Or using the p2/P2 formula: 
 2,500,000 ÷ 5,000,000 x 288,875 = £144,437.50

 Partial relief may also be claimed where the charity and persons who are not charities acquire property together but the charity does not intend to use all of its interest in the property (but does intend to use the majority) for its qualifying charitable purposes. Where there are: 
 
 2 or more buyers in a land transaction who acquire the subject matter of that transaction as tenant in common 
 the charity is not a qualifying charity 
 the charity would, if it were a qualifying charity, be able to claim partial charities relief under the rules for the joint purchase by qualifying charity and another person, and 
 the charity does intend to hold the greater part for qualifying charitable purposes 
 
 The charity is to be treated as though it were a qualifying charity and the rules relating to the joint purchase by a qualifying charity partial relief, including the withdrawal of relief, rules will apply. However, a disqualifying event will also include the following, if not in the furtherance of the charity’s charitable purposes: 
 
 any transfer by the charity of a major interest in the whole or any part of the subject matter of the relieved transactions, or 
 any grant of a lease by the charity for a premium and rent of less than £1,000 per annum of the whole or part of the subject matter of the relieved transaction 
 
 These rules effectively provide the same rules as for a charity that is not a qualifying charity but the charity is to hold the greater part of the land for charitable purposes.

 A charitable trust is one where all the beneficiaries of the trust are charities or all the unit holders of a unit trust are charities. 
 The rules that apply to qualifying charities apply to charitable trusts so that: 
 
 references to the qualifying charitable purposes or charitable purposes of the charity are, in relation to the charitable trust, to the purposes of the beneficiaries or unit holders, and

 Relief from LTT is available in some circumstances to buyers of residential property. 
 Relief may be available to the buyer of a dwelling from an individual in the following circumstances: 
 
 a housebuilder or a property trader buys a dwelling as part of a transaction where the individual buys a new dwelling from the house builder 
 a property trader buys a dwelling from the personal representatives of a deceased person 
 a property trader buys a dwelling where a chain of transactions breaks down 
 an employer or a property trader buys a dwelling from an employee who is re-locating 
 
 If all conditions specified for each type of transaction are fulfilled, the acquisition of the individual’s former dwelling is exempt from charge to LTT. 
 The reliefs that may be claimed by housebuilders and property traders are not available to sole traders, individuals or partnerships with individuals as members (except limited liability partnerships). 
 The buyer will, if the transaction is notifiable, complete a land transaction return and claim the relief that reflects the particular relief available. 
 Partial relief is available where the grounds and garden of the former dwelling are larger than the permitted area but all the other conditions for the relief available have been fulfilled. In these circumstances, a land transaction return should be completed claiming the partial relief available. 
 Relief may be available to buyers exercising collective rights.

 Definitions used in this guidance are as follows: 
 
 ‘housebuilder’ means a company, a limited liability partnership or a partnership whose members are all either companies or limited liability partnerships that carries on the business of constructing or adapting buildings or parts of buildings for use as dwellings. The definition of a housebuilder also includes a company or limited liability partnership connected with it to determine whether a company or limited liability partnership is connected with a housebuilder 
 ‘new dwelling’ ‘means a building or part of a building that has been constructed for use as a single dwelling and has not previously been occupied, or, has been adapted for use as a single dwelling and has not been occupied following that adaptation 
 ‘new place of employment’ means the place where the individual will or will normally perform their employment duties following their relocation 
 ‘permitted amount’ in relation to the refurbishment of a dwelling means £10,000, or 5% of the consideration given to buy the dwelling (but not more than £20,000) whichever is the greater 
 ‘permitted area’ means the area of the garden or grounds of the dwelling that either does not exceed an area of half a hectare, or a larger area if required for the reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling and that larger area represents what is most suitable for the occupation or enjoyment of the dwelling. This does not mean that, for example, stables and a paddock would be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling 
 ‘principal’ (in relation to a property trader) means a director of a company, or a member of a limited liability partnership. In the case of a partnership whose members are entirely made up of companies or limited liability partnerships a principal is a person who is a principal of a member of the partnership (that is, a director of a member company or a member of a member limited liability partnership). Furthermore, principals or employees of a property trader are taken to include principals or employees of a company connected to the property trader 
 ‘property trader’ means a company, a limited liability partnership or a partnership whose members are all either companies or limited liability partnerships that carries on the business of buying and selling dwellings. Anything done by a company connected to the property trader is treated as done by that property trader 
 ‘refurbishment’ of a dwelling means works carried out with the intention to enhance the value of the dwelling, but do not include, cleaning or works to ensure that the dwelling meets minimum safety standards The change of the employee’s residence must have occurred wholly or mainly to allow for reasonable daily travel to that place of employment, and the former residence was not in reasonable daily travel of the new place of employment 
 ‘relocation of employment’ means a change of an individual’s place of work due to: 
	 
 an individual taking up a new employment 
 an alteration in the duties of the individual’s employment, or  
 an alteration in the place where those duties are normally performed 
 
 
 
 Interpretation 
 
 acquisition of a dwelling means the acquisition, by way of grant or transfer, of a major interest in the dwelling 
 market value of a dwelling and of the permitted area means respectively the market value of the major interest in the dwelling and of that interest so far as it relates to the area in question 
 
 An individual, that is a natural person, has to be identified as a seller of the former dwelling and also as a buyer of the new dwelling, although they can act with other individuals as seller or buyer (but cannot act with companies, or other non-natural persons). 
 This would account for cases where the sale and purchase was made with someone else, for example a spouse or partner. These parties do not have to be the same people for both the sale and the purchase, so as to provide for cases where an individual is the sole seller but that individual is a joint buyer. 
 There is no definition of only or main residence, so it is a question of fact whether a property is, or was, the individual’s only or main residence. There is no requirement that the only or main residence should be in the UK. 
 There is no provision for an individual to nominate one property as an only or main residence.

466,466,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Relief for certain acquisitions of dwellings,LTTA/7052 Withdrawal of relief for certain acquisitions of dwellings," (Paragraph 8 Schedule 14) 
 Relief that has been claimed for transactions where a property trader has acquired a dwelling from: 
 
 an individual acquiring a new dwelling from a housebuilder 
 an individual where a chain of transactions breaks down 
 the personal representatives of a deceased individual, or 
 an individual in the case of a relocation of employment 
 
 may be withdrawn. 
 The withdrawal of relief will be triggered, in relation to all property trader reliefs listed above except that which relates to acquisitions from personal representatives of deceased persons, if the property trader: 
 
 spends more than the permitted amount on the refurbishment of the dwelling 
 grants a lease or licence of the dwelling for a period of more than 6 months, or 
 permits any principals or employee (or persons so connected) to occupy the dwelling 
 
 In relation to relief that was claimed in relation to acquisitions from personal representatives of deceased persons, the relief is withdrawn if the property trader: 
 
 spends more than the permitted amount on the refurbishment of the dwelling 
 grants any lease or licence of the dwelling, or 
 permits any principals or employee (or persons so connected) to occupy the dwelling 
 
 In such circumstances the taxpayer must send a further return to the WRA and pay any LTT due as a result of the relief being withdrawn. The amount of tax chargeable is therefore the amount that would have been chargeable in respect to the transaction but for the claim to relief.

467,467,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Relief for certain acquisitions of dwellings,LTTA/7053 Relief for persons exercising collective rights," (Paragraph 10 Schedule 14) 
 This relief is available where leaseholders of flats act together to exercise a statutory right to buy the reversion which is generally the freehold of the building (or buildings) in which the flats are located. 
 The relief applies only where the purchase is in exercise of: 
 
 a right of first refusal under Part 1 Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, or 
 a right of collective enfranchisement under Chapter 1 of Part 1 Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 
 
 In these cases the freehold is acquired in a single transaction by a nominee or appointee (which may be one or more individuals or a company) acting on behalf of the leaseholders. 
 The relief operates so that a reduced amount of tax may be chargeable from that which would be payable absent the claim to relief. It therefore brings the amount of tax more in line with that which would have applied if the leaseholders had been able to purchase their shares of the freehold separately. 
 To determine the amount of tax chargeable the following three steps must be followed: 
 
 the total consideration given for the reversionary freehold is divided by the number of flats leased by tenants who are participating in the exercise of the rights (‘qualifying flats’); 
 the amount of tax is calculated on the amount resulting from the first step; 
 the tax charge arrived at from the second step is multiplied by the number of qualifying flats 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A nominee acting on behalf of the lessees of 8 out of 10 flats in a block, purchases the freehold of the block for £500,000. 
 As the statutory right is being exercised by the lessees of 8 flats, the £500,000 consideration is divided by 8 (£62,500) – step 1. The amount of tax on that sum is £0 – step 2. The result of step 2 is multiplied by the number of qualifying flats, in this example 8. The tax payable is therefore £0 x 8 = £0 – step 3.

The result of step 2 is multiplied by the number of qualifying flats, in this example 8. The tax payable is therefore £0 x 8 = £0 – step 3. 
 
 The nominee or appointee must claim the relief in a land transaction return claiming relief for persons exercising collective rights. 
 ‘Qualifying flats’ means flats held by qualifying tenants who are participating in the exercise of the statutory right concerned, under the terms of that right. This may be fewer than the total number of flats in the block. 
 ‘Flats’ and ‘qualifying tenants’ in respect of each statutory right are defined in the legislation which confers that right. 
 Flats leased by qualifying tenants who reach a separate agreement with the nominee or appointee, but do not participate in the exercise of the statutory right, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of the relief.

469,469,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7061 General overview," (Schedule 16) This schedule provides for relief from LTT where a land transaction is entered into between group companies (or bodies corporate), where certain conditions are met. This relief allows groups to move property for commercial reasons without incurring charges to LTT where the conditions for the relief are met. If the buyer and seller of a chargeable interest are companies (or bodies corporate) and, at the effective date of the land transaction, they are both members of the same group, relief from LTT may be claimed by the buyer. The buyer is not obliged to claim relief and may, however, choose to pay the tax by not claiming the relief. Relief is therefore not available if it is not claimed in a return. There are certain restrictions on availability. Where group relief from LTT has been claimed on a land transaction (the relevant transaction) any subsequent withdrawal of the relief must be reported by the buyer on a new land transaction return. A new land transaction return should also be submitted, reflecting the withdrawal of relief, if: the buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller before the end of a period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction, or,  in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of a period of 3 years, beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction. or: where there is a change of control of the buyer in certain cases involving successive transactions cases.

A company (B Ltd) is the 75% subsidiary of another (A Ltd) if A Ltd satisfies the following conditions: is beneficial owner of not less than 75% of the ordinary share capital (either directly or through another company or companies as determined by applying the rules in sections 1155, 1156 and 1157 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010) of B Ltd is beneficially entitled to not less than 75% of the profits available for distribution to equity holders (either directly or through another company or companies) of B Ltd, and would be beneficially entitled to not less than 75% of any assets (either directly or through another company or companies) of B Ltd available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up for the purposes of establishing whether a shareholder is entitled to profits available for distribution or any assets on a winding-up, the rules in Chapter 6 of Part 5 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 apply. However, sections 171(1)(b) and (3), 173, 174, 176, 177 and 178 are to be treated as though they are omitted. ‘constitutional document’ means a memorandum or articles of association, or similar document regulating the affairs of a joint venture company. ‘control’ has the meaning given by sections 450, 451 and 1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. This means the power of a person to secure that the affairs of the company are conducted in accordance with their wishes: by holding shares in the company or having voting power in, or in relation to, the company by virtue of powers conferred by the articles of association of the company or by virtue of any other document regulating the company. In relation to restrictions on availability of group relief (paragraph 4) the meaning of control is given by section 1124 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. In relation to situations where group relief is not withdrawn where the seller leaves the group (paragraph 10) control is established in accordance with section 450 and 451 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. ‘group company’ means a company that at the effective date of the land transaction, is a member of the same group as the purchaser or seller. ‘joint venture company’ means a company which has 2 or more member companies and the joint venture company carries on a commercial activity governed by an agreement regulating the affairs of the members. ‘member’ in relation a company means a company that is in a group of companies. In relation to a joint venture company it means a holder of shares or securities in a joint venture company. ‘mortgage’ in England and Wales and Northern Ireland means any legal or equitable charge and in Scotland means any right in security. ‘non-group company’ is a company that is not a group company. ‘ordinary share capital’ means all the issued share capital of the company, by whatever name called, apart from that share capital which only confers rights to a fixed dividend, with no other rights to participate in the profits of the company. ‘relevant associated company’ means a company in the same group as the buyer immediately before the buyer ceases to be in the same group as the seller, and, ceases to be in the same group as the seller in consequence of the buyer ceasing to be in that group. In relation to cases in which group relief is not withdrawn (paragraph 9) this definition is slightly different and in relation to the buyer means a company that is in the same group as the buyer that ceases to be in the same group as the acquiring company in consequence of the buyer ceasing to be a member of the group. ‘relevant transfer of business or engagement’ means the following transactions described: a transfer of business etc. to which building societies relief would apply ( paragraph 10(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 22) a transfer of business etc. to which friendly societies relief would apply ( paragraph 11(1) of Schedule 22), and  a transfer of business etc. to which co-operative and community benefit society and credit union relief would apply (paragraph 12(1) of Schedule 22). ‘relieved transaction’ means a transaction that is relieved from LTT as a result of a claim to LTT group relief.

471,471,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7063 Partnerships and other entities in corporate structures," Where the group structure includes a partnership, there are examples of the impact of different types of partnerships on the availability of group relief for a variety of transactions. Where a group structure includes entities other than those created by UK legislation (for example English(https://www.gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-group-relief-technical-guidance) limited partnerships, Scottish partnerships and limited liability partnerships) it will be necessary for the taxpayer to establish which treatment is appropriate for that non-UK entity. For entities that may be treated as one type of entity or another based on a vote by the controlling persons, the treatment of the entity will need to reflect the type of entity elected for at the effective date of the transaction.

472,472,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7064 Group relief: Restrictions on availability," (paragraph 4) Where the buying company (buyer) and selling company (seller) are in the same group, no group relief is available to the purchaser in the following situations: arrangements to transfer control of the purchaser but not the seller arrangements involving the consideration for the transaction arrangements whereby the seller and the buyer cease to be members of the same group.  Arrangements to obtain control of the buyer but not the seller No relief is available where there are arrangements in existence which would mean that a person, or persons, could obtain control of the buyer but not of the seller. This restriction operates where the arrangements are in existence at the effective date of the land transaction, or options etc. are in place at the effective date of the transaction, to bring such arrangements into being. The arrangements must be such that a person, or persons, could obtain control of the buyer on or after the effective date of the transaction. It does not matter whether the arrangements are actually used to transfer control.  
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 A Ltd (the seller) owns a property and sells it to B Ltd (the buyer). The effective date of this land transaction is 1 April 2020. On 1 April 2020, both A Ltd and B Ltd satisfy the requirements for group relief as B Ltd is a 100% subsidiary of A Ltd and all the other tests are fulfilled. However, on 1 April 2020, an agreement is made for A Ltd to sell the shares in B Ltd to an unconnected, third party, C Ltd. Group relief is not available to B Ltd because this arrangement would mean that C Ltd would obtain control of B Ltd (the buyer) but not of A Ltd (the seller). B Ltd will have to make a land transaction return, cannot claim relief in that return and will have to pay any LTT.

 Arrangements involving the buyer ceasing to be in the same group as the seller Group relief is not available where, in connection with, or in pursuance of, an arrangement or arrangements, the buyer ceases (or could cease) to be in the same group as the seller. This applies where the arrangements act so that the buyer ceases (or could cease) to be a 75% subsidiary of the seller or a third company and so ceases (or could cease) to be in the same group as the seller. See also guidance in relation to rules relating to the withdrawal of group relief where the buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller following the date of the land transaction. Arrangements involving the consideration for the transaction Group relief is not available where a non-group company (or other person), at the effective date of the transaction, is to provide or receive all or part of the consideration for the transaction, and this is done in connection with, or in pursuance of, an arrangement. The relief is not available whether the consideration is provided or received directly or indirectly. This applies: whether the seller, buyer or another group company are party to the arrangements when the arrangements mean that part of the consideration is provided or received as a consequence of the carrying out of a transaction (or transactions) involving a payment (or payments) or receipt (or receipts) by a person other than a group company.

473,473,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7065 Exceptions to restrictions on availability," (paragraphs 4(2), 5 and 6) Arrangements to transfer control of the buyer but not the seller; section 75 Finance Act 1986 - scheme for reconstruction (paragraph 4(2)) The general rule prohibiting a claim to group relief does not apply where arrangements are entered into with a view to the acquisition of shares by a company (the acquiring company) that is neither the buyer nor seller in the land transaction. The share transaction must be a transaction to which section 75 Finance Act 1986 (acquisition of the whole or part of an undertaking in pursuance of a scheme for the reconstruction of the target company) will apply, all the conditions for that relief are met, and the buyer in the land transaction will be in the same group as the acquiring company in the share transaction. Group relief in relation to transactions carried out in preparation for an acquisition to which section 75 Finance Act 1986 applies will, if they are the following 2 situations, still be able to be subject to a valid group relief claim (so long as all other relevant conditions are met): Arrangements whereby someone could obtain control of the transferee but not of the transferor (‘control’ arrangements) (paragraph 4(1) of schedule 16) Arrangements whereby transferor and transferee will cease to be members of the same group by reason of the transferee ceasing to be a 75% subsidiary of the transferor or of a third company’ (‘de-grouping’ arrangements) (paragraph 4(3)(b) of Schedule 16). Therefore, any acquisitions to which section 75 Finance Act 1986 apply will include both a change of control and a de-grouping arrangement. However, group relief is still available because paragraph 4(2)(c) has the effect that arrangements entered into with a view to an acquisition to which section 75 Finance Act 1986 applies are not ‘control’ arrangements denying group relief. Whilst, paragraph 4(3)(b) does not include a similar proviso, paragraph 4 must be read as a whole and the proviso must therefore apply also to paragraph 4(3)(b), otherwise it would in practice be of no effect. The WRA therefore accepts that arrangements entered into with a view to an acquisition to which section 75 Finance Act 1986 applies, are not ‘de-grouping’ arrangements denying group relief. Arrangements entered into by joint venture companies (paragraph 5) Where a joint venture company enters into arrangements that would constitute arrangements which would result in group relief not being available, the relief may still be available where the arrangements have been entered into by a joint venture company. The arrangements must be either: an agreement which provides for the transfer of shares or securities in the joint venture company to one or more members of that company on or as a result of one or more named contingency happening, or a provision in a constitutional document of the joint venture company which provides for the suspension of a member’s voting rights on or as a result of one or more named contingency occurring. The named contingencies are: the voluntary departure of a member the commencement of the liquidation, administration, administrative receivership or receivership of, or the entering into of a voluntary arrangement by, a member under the Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) or the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order1989 (S.I.1989/2405 (N.I.19)) or the commencement, or entering into, of equivalent proceedings or arrangements under the law of any country or territory outside the United Kingdom a serious deterioration in the financial condition of a member a change of control of a member a default by a member in performing its obligations under any agreement between the members or with the joint venture company (which, for this purpose, includes any constitutional document of the joint venture company) an external change in the commercial circumstances in which the joint venture company operates such that its viability is threatened an unresolved disagreement between the members, and any contingency of a similar kind to that mentioned in any of the bullet points above which is provided for, but not intended to happen, when the arrangements in question were entered into.  However, this exception does not apply to cases where a member (alone or with connected persons) can, prior to a named contingency occurring, dictate the timing of the transfer of share or securities or the suspension of a member’s voting rights. For the purposes of this particular rule members are not connected with each other by virtue of their membership of the joint venture company.   Arrangements entered into in relation to mortgages (paragraph 6) In the scenario where group relief wouldn’t be available by virtue of a mortgage arrangement resulting in the seller and buyer ceasing to be members of the same group, the relief may still be available if: the mortgage is secured over shares or securities in the company which on default or other event allows the mortgagee (the person lending money) to exercise its rights (most commonly this means the right to enter into possession of the mortgaged interest, or the power of sale) against the mortgagor the person borrowing money), and the mortgagee has not exercised its rights against the mortgagor. However, group relief will still not be available if the above conditions are met if the arrangements are such that the mortgagee: possesses greater rights in respect of the shares and securities which are the subject of the mortgage than it requires to protect its interest as mortgagee, or alone or together with connected persons could dictate the terms or timing of the default or other event which would allow the mortgagee to exercise its rights against the mortgagor. For the purposes of this particular rule the mortgagee is not connected with a company whose shares or securities are the subject of the mortgage.

474,474,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7066 Withdrawal of group relief," (paragraph 8) Group relief must be withdrawn if the buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller: before the end of a period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction, or in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of a period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction. Withdrawal of group relief will occur if at the time the buyer ceases to be in the same group as the seller, the buyer (or a relevant associated company) holds: the chargeable interest that was acquired under the relevant transaction, or a chargeable interest derived from the chargeable interest acquired under the relevant transaction (for example, if a headlease was acquired under the relevant land transaction, the reversion of a sublease granted out of that headlease would be a chargeable interest derived from the original chargeable interest, and, the chargeable interest has not subsequently been acquired at market value by means of a chargeable transaction where group relief was available but was not claimed. Withdrawal of group relief: amount payable (paragraph 8) Where it is necessary to withdraw group relief, the amount of relief withdrawn depends on: the chargeable interest obtained by the buyer on the effective date of the original land transaction the chargeable interest held by the buyer (and any relevant associated company) at the time of the event withdrawing group relief. The effect of withdrawing the relief is to tax the chargeable interest remaining with the buyer (and any relevant associated company) as if no claim to group relief had been made. The LTT payable is that which would have been payable in respect of the original land transaction for which group relief was claimed. The chargeable consideration for the transaction is calculated as the market value of the chargeable interest transferred by the original land transaction, and if the acquisition was the grant of a lease at a rent, the amount of that rent. This rule is modified where the chargeable interest held by the buyer (and any relevant associated company) at the time group relief is withdrawn, is not the same as the chargeable interest transferred by the original land transaction. In such a case the LTT payable is that which would have been payable in respect of an appropriate proportion of the original land transaction for which relief was claimed. The appropriate proportion is the fraction of the market values of the chargeable interests held by the purchaser and any relevant associated companies at the time of the withdrawal of group relief. The appropriate proportion is calculated by reference to the effective date of the relevant land transaction compared to the market value of the chargeable interest obtained by the buyer at the effective date of the relevant land transaction. Withdrawal of group relief in certain cases involving successive transactions (paragraph 12) Where the following 4 conditions are met, the rules about withdrawal of group relief apply to a relevant transaction (i.e. a transaction for which group relief was claimed) as if the seller in relation to the earliest previous transaction was the seller in relation to the relevant transaction: there is a change in control of the buyer the change occurs: before the end of the period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the transaction which is exempt from charge by virtue of this schedule (‘the relevant transaction’), or in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of that period; the relief in relation to the relevant transaction would not be withdrawn on the previous transaction by the buyer ceasing to be a member of the same group as the seller; and, in relation to any previous transaction: the previous transaction is relieved from charge by virtue of it being a relieved transaction for LTT group relief purposes, or reconstruction relief or acquisition relief; the effective date of the previous transaction is less than 3 years before the date of the change mentioned in the first condition the chargeable interest acquired under the relevant transaction by the buyer in relation to that transaction is the same as, comprises, forms part of, or is derived from, the chargeable interest acquired under the previous transaction by the buyer in relation to the previous transaction, and since the previous transaction, the chargeable interest acquired under that transaction has not been acquired by any person under a transaction that is not relieved from charge by virtue of group relief, reconstruction relief or acquisition relief. If 2 or more transactions effected at the same time are the earliest previous transactions the reference above to the seller in relation to the earliest previous transaction means any of the sellers in those earliest transactions. There is a change in the control of a company if: a person who controls the company (alone or with others) ceases to do so a person obtains control of the company (alone or with others), or the company is wound up. Control is to be established in accordance with section 450 and 451 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. Cases in which group relief is not withdrawn (paragraph 9) Group relief is not withdrawn where the buyer ceases to be in the same group as the seller because of: anything done for the purposes of, or in the course of, winding up the seller or another company above the seller in the group structure, or the seller or another company above the seller in the group structure ceasing to exist. A company is above the seller in the group structure if the seller (or another company above the seller in the group structure) is a 75% subsidiary of that company. Additionally, group relief is not withdrawn if the buyer ceases to be in the same group as the seller as a result of an acquisition of shares by another company (the acquiring company) in relation to which:  section 75 Finance Act 1986 applies (relief for the acquisition of the whole or part of an undertaking in pursuance of a scheme for the reconstruction of a target company) applies the conditions for relief under section 75 Finance Act 1986 are met, and immediately after that acquisition, the buyer is in the same group as the acquiring company. However, if relief is not withdrawn because of an acquisition of shares under an arrangement that complies with the requirements of section 75 Finance Act 1986, relief may still be withdrawn if the buyer ceases to be in the same group as the acquiring company: before the end of a period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction, or in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of a period of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relevant land transaction, and the chargeable interest that was acquired by the buyer in the relevant land transaction, or a chargeable interest derived from the chargeable interest acquired in the relevant land transaction (for example, if a headlease was acquired under the relevant land transaction, the reversion of a sublease granted out of that headlease would be a chargeable interest derived from the original chargeable interest), and the chargeable interest has not subsequently been acquired at market value by means of a chargeable transaction where group relief was available but was not claimed. Seller leaves the group: group relief is not withdrawn (paragraph 10) Group relief is not withdrawn if the buyer is not in the same group as the seller as a result of the seller leaving the group. The seller is considered to have left the group if it ceases to be in the same group as the buyer as a result of a transaction relating to shares. The transaction in shares must have been in the seller itself or in another company that is above the seller which, as a result of the share transaction in that company, means that the seller has ceased to be in the same group as the seller. A company is above the seller in the group structure if the seller (or another company above the seller in the group structure) is a 75% subsidiary of that company. However, if there is a subsequent change in control of the buyer within 3 years of the effective date of the group-relieved intra group transfer, or at any time in the pursuance of or in connection with arrangements made before the end of that period, then the relief will still be withdrawn.

Although B Ltd is no longer part of the same group as S Ltd, group relief is not withdrawn at this stage. 2 years after the purchase by B Ltd, P Ltd sells its shares in B Ltd to an unconnected third party. This change in control of B Ltd will now trigger withdrawal of the original group relief. Withdrawal of group relief will similarly be triggered if there is a change in the control of P Ltd as this effectively changes the control of B Ltd.

475,475,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Group relief,LTTA/7067 Change in control," There is a change in control of the purchaser if: a person who controls the purchaser (alone or with others) ceases to do so, a person obtains control of the purchaser ( alone or with others) or, the purchaser is wound up. Any references to control are to be interpreted in accordance with section 450 and 451 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. This defines control as: control over the affairs of the company control through voting power control through share capital or through issued share capital control over income of the company control over the assets of the company. Further information concerning control is available in the  HMRC guidance(https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm60200) . For the purposes of this rule, there is not deemed to be a change in control of the buyer because a loan creditor obtains control or ceases to control the buyer, so long as the other persons who controlled the buyer before the change arising from the loan creditors control continue to control the buyer. A loan creditor for these purposes is defined in section 453 of the Corporation Tax Act. Similarly, a change in control does not arise where a new holding company is inserted either between the original ultimate parent company and its shareholders, or between the purchaser and the parent company so long as there is no change in overall economic ownership of the group. However, where this is a sale of an entire group and this has occurred within 3 years of the transaction, a withdrawal of group relief will be triggered as there has been a change in control of the buyer company, unless the seller remains in the same group as the buyer. Furthermore, a ‘minimum controlling combinations’ test will be applied in order to establish whether there has been 'actual' change in ownership of the asset. For example, if 3 persons, A, B and C, each hold one third of the shares in a company, and are not connected in any way which would allow the rights and powers of one to be attributed to another, then control is held by A and B, B and C, or A and C but not A, B and C together. This is because for the purposes of the minimum controlling combinations, the combinations containing superfluous persons are disregarded. If A leaves, the minimum controlling combination test ensures that a change in control will not be triggered. This reflects the fact that B and C 'control' the company before and after A's departure. However, if both A and B leave and are replaced by new shareholders D and E (each owing a third of the shares) then the minimum controlling combination test is no longer satisfied. In this situation a change in control has occurred. Further information regarding  minimum controlling combinations on GOV.UK(https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/company-taxation-manual/ctm60250) . Share Options It is possible for an option over shares to result in two unrelated parties both being treated as having control of a company. This is because a person is taken to have control of a company if they exercise, or is entitled to acquire, direct or indirect control over the company's affairs. An option over shares will not be taken into account in determining whether there has been a change in control of the purchaser. The grant or entitlement date to the shares will be the point at which an 'inalienable' right to the shares is triggered. This is when any conditions attaching to share options are considered to be satisfied and it is at this point that a change in control of the buyer may occur. If the application of a minimum controlling combinations test at this point does not result in a change in control, then group relief will not be withdrawn. However, if a change in control does occur as a result of the granting of the shares, then group relief will be withdrawn. Control established through different tests It is possible for more than one person or one group of persons to 'control' a company. For example, one person may have a greater part of the voting power, while another person may hold the greater part of the assets on winding up or right to income. All 3 combinations of people can be taken to have control of the company at the same time. If there was a change in one of these 3 combinations, then a change in control would be triggered, which could result in relief being withdrawn. However, in this situation there will not be a withdrawal of relief if one of the minimum controlling combinations established under the tests for control is present and that results in control of the buyer and seller remaining in the same persons. Circumstances that do not constitute a change in control Liquidation The appointment of a liquidator and any subsequent liquidation, results in a company losing its beneficial interest in its assets, including any shares it owns in other companies. The commencement of a winding up of a holding company within a group would result in the breaking up of a group. This may present difficulties for groups undertaking genuine reorganisations. The WRA, in view of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance’s stated intention during the passage of the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017 through the Assembly, to provide consistency of treatment before and on and after 1 April 2018, will not view the appointment of a liquidator as resulting in a change of control of a company for the purposes of sub- paragraph 10(5)(b), provided that the liquidation can be shown to be part of a scheme of reconstruction which involves a successful claim to reconstruction or group relief or where the economic ownership of the relevant assets remains within the group. Similarly the eventual liquidation of that company will not be regarded as giving rise to a change in control of its subsidiaries (if any) where the transfer of those shares on the liquidation involves a successful claim to relief from stamp duty or where the economic ownership of those shares remains within the group. Share transactions in quoted companies The WRA, in view of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance’s stated intention during the passage of the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017 through the Assembly, to provide consistency of treatment before and on and after 1 April 2018, will not construe the meaning of a change in control so widely that simple day to day transactions between unconnected minority shareholders in a quoted company will be seen as a change in control. Partnerships Where the purchaser group's majority shareholder is a partnership a withdrawal of group relief may arise if a partner leaves the partnership or a new partner joins, however small the relevant partnership interest is. The WRA, in view of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance’s stated intention during the passage of the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017 through the Assembly, to provide consistency of treatment before and on and after 1 April 2018, the rights or powers held by partners will not be attributed for the purposes of group relief. Furthermore, any changes in the general partner will also be disregarded for the purposes of establishing whether there has been a change in control. 
 
 Examples: withdrawal of group relief 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 - Buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller within 3 years 
 
 
   
 B Ltd is 100% owned by A Ltd. These 2 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. A Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to B Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on that date. B Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. A Ltd sells the shares in B Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,750,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares B Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026. As the buyer (B Ltd) left the same group as the seller (A Ltd) before the end of the period of 3 years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief is withdrawn as no exceptions apply. B Ltd still holds the freehold interest which was the subject of the relevant transaction (the transfer of the interest from A Ltd to B Ltd). The LTT payable is that which would have been payable on the original land transaction, i.e. on the market value at the effective date of the original land transaction of £1,000,000. No account is taken of the increase in value of the freehold interest as it is the relief claimed at the time of the relevant transaction that is withdrawn. Similarly, no account would be taken of any fall in value. An LTT return must be made by 31 July 2026. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 - Buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller within 3 years, property transferred to another group company 
 
 
   
 E Ltd is 100% owned by D Ltd. D Ltd is 100% owned by C Ltd. All 3 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. C Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to D Ltd (the purchaser) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. D Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. D Ltd then transfers the freehold interest to E Ltd for £250,000 on 1 October 2024. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,100,000 on 1 October 2024. E Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. C Ltd sells the shares in D Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,750,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares, D Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026 (and E Ltd goes with it at it is a 100% subsidiary of D Ltd). As the buyer (D Ltd) left the same group as C Ltd (the seller) before the end of the period of three years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief is withdrawn as no exceptions apply. D Ltd and its relevant associated company (E Ltd) still hold the freehold interest which was the subject of the relevant transaction (the transfer of the interest from C Ltd to D Ltd). The LTT payable is that which would have been payable on the original transaction, therefore LTT will be payable on the market value of £1,000,000 (i.e. the market value at the effective date of the original land transaction). No account is taken on the increase in value of the freehold interest as it is the relief claimed at the time of the relevant transaction that is withdrawn. Group relief is not withdrawn on the transfer of the chargeable interest from D Ltd to E Ltd as D Ltd and E Ltd are still in the same group as they were when the chargeable interest was transferred to E Ltd. An LTT return must be made by 31 July 2026. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 - Purchaser ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller within 3 years, property transferred to another group company 
 
 
   
 H Ltd is 100% owned by G Ltd. G Ltd is 100% owned by F Ltd. All 3 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. F Ltd (the seller) transfers the freehold interest in a parcel of land to G Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the ‘relevant transaction’. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. G Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. G Ltd then transfers the freehold interest to H Ltd for £1,100,000 on 1 October 2024. The market value of the freehold interest on that date is £1,100,000. H Ltd could claim group relief in respect of the transfer but does not. LTT is paid on this land transaction on the consideration given of £1,100,000. F Ltd sells the shares in G Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,750,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares, G Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026 (and H Ltd goes with it as it is a 100% subsidiary of G Ltd). As the buyer (G Ltd) left the same group as F Ltd (the seller) before the end of the period of 3 years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief may be withdrawn. However, the subject of the relevant transaction (the freehold interest) has been the subject of a subsequent acquisition at market value (by H Ltd). LTT was paid on this transaction (at the time) and so there is no further LTT to pay. Had H Ltd not paid LTT on the market value when it acquired the freehold interest on 1 October 2024, group relief would have been withdrawn on 1 July 2026 when H Ltd left the group. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 4 - Buyer ceases to be a member of the same group as the seller within 3 years change in chargeable interest held 
 
 
   
 N Ltd is 100% owned by M Ltd. These 2 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. M Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to N Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. N Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. N Ltd grants a lease to an unconnected third party for market value on 1 October 2024. LTT would be payable by the unconnected third party (absent any relief they may be entitled to on the transaction) on the rents and consideration other than rent paid by them. M Ltd sells the shares in N Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold reversionary interest and right to receive rent is £900,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares, N Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026. As the buyer (N Ltd) left the same group as M Ltd (the seller) before the end of the period of 3 years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief is withdrawn as no exceptions apply. N Ltd now holds the freehold reversionary interest rather than the freehold which was the subject of the relevant transaction (the transfer of the interest from M Ltd to N Ltd). The LTT payable is that which would have been payable on the appropriate proportion of the original transaction, taking account the chargeable interest transferred by the original transaction and the chargeable interest now held. The market value of the chargeable interest now held has to be ascertained as at the date of the relevant transaction that is 1 June 2024. If this was £850,000, the LTT payable is calculated on the market value of the relevant transaction, that is on the market value of the freehold interest (£1,000,000) and reduced by the appropriate proportion i.e. 850,000/1,000,000. Therefore N Ltd would need to send in a return by 31 July 2026 showing consideration of £150,000.

 N Ltd is 100% owned by M Ltd. These 2 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. M Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to N Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. N Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. N Ltd grants a lease to an unconnected third party for market value on 1 October 2024. LTT would be payable by the unconnected third party (absent any relief they may be entitled to on the transaction) on the rents and consideration other than rent paid by them. M Ltd sells the shares in N Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold reversionary interest and right to receive rent is £900,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares, N Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026. As the buyer (N Ltd) left the same group as M Ltd (the seller) before the end of the period of 3 years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief is withdrawn as no exceptions apply. N Ltd now holds the freehold reversionary interest rather than the freehold which was the subject of the relevant transaction (the transfer of the interest from M Ltd to N Ltd). The LTT payable is that which would have been payable on the appropriate proportion of the original transaction, taking account the chargeable interest transferred by the original transaction and the chargeable interest now held. The market value of the chargeable interest now held has to be ascertained as at the date of the relevant transaction that is 1 June 2024. If this was £850,000, the LTT payable is calculated on the market value of the relevant transaction, that is on the market value of the freehold interest (£1,000,000) and reduced by the appropriate proportion i.e. 850,000/1,000,000. Therefore N Ltd would need to send in a return by 31 July 2026 showing consideration of £150,000.

If this was £850,000, the LTT payable is calculated on the market value of the relevant transaction, that is on the market value of the freehold interest (£1,000,000) and reduced by the appropriate proportion i.e. 850,000/1,000,000. Therefore N Ltd would need to send in a return by 31 July 2026 showing consideration of £150,000. 
 
 
 
 
 N Ltd is 100% owned by M Ltd. These 2 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. M Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to N Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. N Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. N Ltd grants a lease to an unconnected third party for market value on 1 October 2024. LTT would be payable by the unconnected third party (absent any relief they may be entitled to on the transaction) on the rents and consideration other than rent paid by them. M Ltd sells the shares in N Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold reversionary interest and right to receive rent is £900,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of this sale of shares, N Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026. As the buyer (N Ltd) left the same group as M Ltd (the seller) before the end of the period of 3 years from the date of the relevant transaction (which period would end on 31 May 2027), group relief is withdrawn as no exceptions apply. N Ltd now holds the freehold reversionary interest rather than the freehold which was the subject of the relevant transaction (the transfer of the interest from M Ltd to N Ltd). The LTT payable is that which would have been payable on the appropriate proportion of the original transaction, taking account the chargeable interest transferred by the original transaction and the chargeable interest now held. The market value of the chargeable interest now held has to be ascertained as at the date of the relevant transaction that is 1 June 2024. If this was £850,000, the LTT payable is calculated on the market value of the relevant transaction, that is on the market value of the freehold interest (£1,000,000) and reduced by the appropriate proportion i.e. 850,000/1,000,000. Therefore N Ltd would need to send in a return by 31 July 2026 showing consideration of £150,000.

 P Ltd is 100% owned by O Ltd. R Ltd is also 100% owned by O Ltd. These 3 companies form a group for the purposes of LTT. P Ltd (the seller) transfers a freehold interest to R Ltd (the buyer) for no consideration on 1 June 2024. This is the relevant transaction. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,000,000 on 1 June 2024. R Ltd claims group relief in respect of the transfer. O Ltd then sells the shares in P Ltd to an unconnected third party on 1 July 2026. The market value of the freehold interest is £1,750,000 on 1 July 2026. As a result of the sale of shares P Ltd leaves the group on 1 July 2026. Group relief is not withdrawn. This is because the only reason the buyer (R Ltd) has ceased to be a member of the same group as the seller (P Ltd) is because the seller has left the group, and there has been no change of control of R Ltd (the buyer) by its parent company, O Ltd.

This is because the only reason the buyer (U Ltd) has ceased to be a member of the same group as the seller (W Ltd) is because the seller has left the group as a result of a share transaction in another company (T Ltd). This would also apply if instead of S Ltd selling all the shares in T Ltd, it only sold enough shares so that it no longer owned 75% of them and thus T Ltd (and W Ltd) were no longer grouped.

480,480,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7035 Relief for acquisitions involving multiple dwellings," This relief is available where a taxpayer buys a number of dwellings in Wales from the same seller either in a single transaction with the same effective date or in a number of linked transactions (transactions are linked where they form part of a single scheme, arrangement, or series of transactions between the same buyer and seller or persons connected to them). 
 In applying for multiple dwellings relief, the taxpayer will need to apply the higher residential property rates where the transaction would be subject to the higher rates for residential property rules, or the main residential property rates in cases where the higher rates for residential property rules would not apply (i.e. a mixed use property transaction). 
 Where the relief is claimed, the amount of LTT which applies to the consideration attributable to interests in dwellings is determined by reference to the amount of the total consideration attributable to the dwellings, divided by the number of dwellings (to establish the mean consideration attributable to the dwellings). In the event that the amount of tax calculated by this method is less than 1% of the consideration given, a minimum amount of tax rule is triggered to ensure an effective tax rate of at least 1% is applied to transactions involving multiple dwellings. 
 The amount of LTT which applies to the consideration attributable to interests in land other than dwellings (if any) is the amount which would apply in the absence of the relief. 
 Superior freehold or leasehold interests in dwellings subject to leases granted for an initial period of 21 years or more are not eligible for relief. 
 The relief includes ‘off-plan’ purchases where construction or adaptation of the property for residential use may not have commenced by the effective date of the transaction.  
 Most purchases of multiple dwellings will be liable to the rates applicable to higher rates residential property transactions. 
 Multiple dwellings relief is a partial relief as an element of LTT will always be payable on the transaction. The relief code 50 should be used in the taxpayer’s return to claim the relief.

481,481,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7036 Transactions to which relief applies," (paragraph 3) 
 General rule 
 Relief may be claimed where the transaction is a ‘relevant transaction’. A relevant transaction is one where the main subject-matter consists of: 
 
 an interest in at least 2 dwellings, or, an interest in at least 2 dwellings and other property (for example non-residential property) 
 an interest in a dwelling, or an interest in a dwelling and other property, and that transaction is one of a number of linked transactions and the linked transaction included an interest in at least one other dwelling 
 
 An ‘interest in a dwelling’ for the purposes of this relief is any chargeable interest in or over a dwelling; therefore, all the dwellings subject to this relief have to be in Wales.  
 Exceptions and exclusions 
 Multiple dwellings relief cannot be claimed where the transaction could be eligible for relief for transactions entered into by persons exercising collective rights. 
 Furthermore, multiple dwellings relief is not available where group relief, reconstruction and acquisition relief or charities relief can be claimed for the transaction, even in the event that the relief is not claimed or is withdrawn. 
 Where the dwelling is subject to a lease which was granted with a term of more than 21 years, any superior interest in relation to that lease cannot treated as an interest in a dwelling for the purposes of the relief and that interest cannot therefore be included in the calculation of the number of dwellings acquired by the taxpayer. 
 The 21 year lease rule does not, however, apply when either: 
 
 the seller is a qualifying body for the purposes of the relief applying to shared ownership leases 
 
 or, 
 
 the transaction is made under a sale and leaseback arrangement, and 
 the sale is the grant of a leasehold interest, and 
 the leaseback element of that arrangement is relieved from tax by a claim to sale and leaseback relief 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr A buys, from the same seller 5 interests in a block of 4 flats. He buys the leasehold on each of the 4 flats, each of which lasts for 99 years; he buys the freehold over the whole building which incorporates the 4 flats. As the leases have been granted for more than 21 years the superior interest, in this case the freehold, cannot be treated as an interest in a dwelling for the purposes of multiple dwellings relief and cannot therefore be included in the calculation of the number of dwellings acquired by the taxpayer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 Ms B buys, from the same seller, 3 interests in dwellings. The first and second are leasehold interests with 95 years remaining in 2 flats that are not subject to any sub leases. The third is the freehold interest in a house that is subject to a lease to an unconnected third party that was originally granted for 125 years. Ms A has therefore acquired 2 interests to which the multiple dwellings relief can apply and 1 interest in a dwelling that is treated as other property for the purposes of this relief.

Ms A has therefore acquired 2 interests to which the multiple dwellings relief can apply and 1 interest in a dwelling that is treated as other property for the purposes of this relief.

482,482,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7037 Key terms and definitions," (paragraph 4) 
 ‘Attributable’ means attributable on a just and reasonable apportionment. 
 The ‘consideration attributable to dwellings’ is for a single dwelling transaction the chargeable consideration attributable to that dwelling, and for a multiple dwelling transaction is the chargeable consideration that is attributable to the dwellings in total. 
 ‘The remaining consideration’ is chargeable consideration for the transaction less the consideration attributable to dwellings. 
 A ‘single dwelling transaction’ is a transaction that has as its main subject-matter an interest in a single dwelling or an interest in a single dwelling and other property. 
 A ‘multiple dwelling transaction’ is a transaction that has as its main subject-matter an interest in at least 2 dwellings or an interest in at least 2 dwellings and other property. 
 Where a taxpayer is buying a property which comprises of a main house and an annex to claim multiple dwellings relief it is important that both the main house and the annex meet the criteria of being a dwelling. Further guidance is available at  LTTA/8080(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#section-5219) .

483,483,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7038 Calculation of LTT liability: determining the tax related to consideration attributable to dwellings," Where a claim to multiple dwellings relief (MDR) is made, the tax due on a transaction will be the sum of 2 amounts: 
 
 ‘tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings’, and where relevant, 
 ‘tax related to the remaining consideration’ 
 
 You can use our  MDR calculator(https://www.gov.wales/calculate-land-transaction-tax-multiple-dwellings-relief)(https://www.gov.wales/calculate-land-transaction-tax-multiple-dwellings-relief)  to help work out how much LTT is payable with a claim for the relief. 
 The method for establishing this amount of tax due follows 4 steps. 
 
 Establish the amount of tax that would be payable on the consideration given for the total dwellings in Wales. The amount of the tax due is established by dividing the consideration by the number of dwellings acquired. Then establishing the liability for that notional purchase of a single dwelling. 
 
	The rates that apply for this part of the tax calculation will generally be higher rates for residential property transactions. In all other cases, main residential rates should be applied to the dwellings, such as where dwellings are part of a mixed-use property transaction. 
 
	Where 6 or more dwellings are acquired, the taxpayer can claim MDR, and the total dwellings would be subject to higher residential rates. If MDR is not claimed, the total consideration would be subject to non-residential property rates. 
	  
 Multiply the amount of tax established under step 1 by the number of dwellings. 
	  
 The amount established at step 2 will be the amount of tax payable for the acquisition of the dwellings (additional LTT may be due for the transaction if there’s also remaining consideration that’s part of the same transaction). However, for linked transactions related to dwellings, also use step 4. 
	  
 The amount of tax established by step 2 must be multiplied by CD ÷ TDC 
	where:
	 
 CD is the consideration attributable to dwellings for the relevant transaction, and 
 TDC is the total dwellings consideration 
 
 
 
 The ‘total dwellings consideration’ is: 
 
 for a transaction that’s not one of a number of linked transactions, the consideration attributable to dwellings for that transaction 
 for a transaction that’s one of a number of linked transactions:
	 
 the total consideration attributable to dwellings for that transaction, plus 
 all the other transactions that are linked transactions, plus 
 so much of the chargeable consideration for any other linked transaction (whether or not relevant transactions) that’s not included in either of the 2 amounts of consideration above, but that are attributable to for the same dwellings included in the calculations 
 
 
 
 ‘Total dwellings’ means the number of dwellings by reference to which the total dwellings consideration is calculated. 
 Where relevant, the taxpayer must also consider the minimum tax amount. If the amount of tax calculated above is less than that amount, the LTT payable based on calculation is replaced by that amount. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 
 Mr A buys 3 dwellings from B Ltd on the same effective date (1 January 2022). 
 Mr A already owns his own home and the 3 dwellings are the first acquisitions as he builds a buy to let portfolio. Therefore he’s liable to the rates that apply to higher rates residential property transactions. 
 Mr A and B Ltd completed a single contract for sale and acquisition of all 3 flats, and the flats are individually priced in that contract at £80,000, £95,000 and £107,000.  
 
 As there are no linked transactions and no remaining consideration, only steps 1 to 3 apply. 
 
 Requires chargeable consideration to be divided by the number of dwellings. The relevant figures are; chargeable consideration is £282,000, the number of dwellings is 3. The average consideration for each dwelling is £94,000. The tax due on that amount is then calculated. Using the rates, in force at 22 December 2020, the liability is £3,760. 
 Requires the amount in step 1 to be multiplied by the total dwellings (the number of dwellings acquired in this transaction). The amount is therefore £3,760 x 3 = £11,280. 
 The tax liability = £11,280. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 
 
 
   
 
 B Ltd from example 1 above completes another block of flats and Mr A buys a further 2 flats in that block on 15 January 2022. 
 The transactions in both examples 1 and 2 are linked transactions. 
 The new flats cost £125,000 and £185,000 respectively and are purchased together in one transaction. 
 The example assumes the tax rates and bands have not changed from 22 December 2020. 
 
 All 4 steps must be applied to the new transaction. 
 
 Requires total dwellings consideration to be divided by the number of dwellings. The relevant figures are: total dwellings consideration is £282,000 + £125,000 + £185,000 = £592,000, the number of dwellings is now 5. The averaged consideration for each dwelling is now £118,400. The tax due on that amount is then calculated. The liability is £4,736. 
 Requires the amount in step 1 to be multiplied by the total dwellings (the number of dwellings acquired in this transaction). The amount is therefore £4,736 x 5 = £23,680. 
 The tax liability for the linked transactions is £23,680. As there are linked transactions, the tax due on the current transaction must be calculated using step 4. 
 Requires the amount of tax established by step 2 to be multiplied by CD/TDC. In this case the figure for CD is £310,000 (£125,000 + £185,000) and for TDC the figure is £592,000. The sum therefore is: 
 
 (310,000 ÷ 592,000) x £23,680 = £12,400. 
 
This is the sum of tax that should be self-assessed on the return for the second transaction acquiring the 2 new flats. In this case, a further land transaction return is not required for the first transaction (in which the 3 flats were acquired) as the tax payable on the second return (£12,400) added to the tax self-assessed on the first return (£11,280) add up to the total tax payable for the 2 transactions (£23,680). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 3 
 
 
   
 Applying the minimum 1% tax charge rule 
 
 Ms C acquires from Mr and Mrs D 2 dwellings, and no other property, in a single transaction. 
 The consideration given for the transaction is £270,000. 
 The dwellings have individual market values of £190,000 and £80,000. 
 Ms C does not own any other dwellings and is to occupy the more expensive home as her main residence. The less expensive dwelling is in the grounds of the more expensive dwelling. 
 The conditions for subsidiary dwelling exemption in the higher rates residential property transactions rules are met. The higher rates will not therefore apply to the transaction. 
 
 Using the various steps, the liability would equal £0. Because the average consideration given is £135,000 for the 2 dwellings and the applicable tax rate is 0%. 
 But the minimum tax rule will apply in this case as the LTT on the consideration given is less than 1% of that amount of consideration. Therefore, the minimum consideration rule means the tax to be self-assessed is £2,700 (£270,000 x 1%). 
 Had Ms C not claimed MDR the tax due would be calculated based on the main rates of LTT. Using the rates, in force on 10 October 2022, Ms C would’ve needed to self-assess her liability as £2,700 ((£0 to £225,000 x 0% = £0) + (£225,001 to £270,000 x 6%= £2,700)).

484,484,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7039 Calculation of LTT liability: determining the tax related to the remaining consideration," (paragraph 7) 
 A taxpayer may on occasion enter into a transaction that consists of dwellings and/or other residential and non-residential properties. In such cases, the taxpayer can still claim multiple dwellings relief (MDR) in relation to the consideration given for the dwellings.  
 Where we refer to ‘other residential properties’ we mean those that are not dwellings for the purpose this relief. 
 The consideration given for the other property must be calculated separately and added to the tax that applies to the dwellings. 
 Where the transaction relates to one that includes dwellings and other property that’s also residential property, the rates applicable to higher rates of residential property transactions will apply to the calculation of the liability due on the dwellings to establish the multiple dwellings liability. 
 But the main rates will be used to establish the consideration on the other residential property that does not consist of dwellings. 
 Because the claim to MDR must consider the acquisition of the dwellings separately from the other property acquired. The same is true where the other property is non-residential. 
 ‘The tax related to the remaining consideration’ is given by an apportionment of the tax that would’ve been due on the total transaction. That amount is multiplied by a fraction. The fraction is given by dividing the ‘remaining consideration’ by the total consideration. The calculation is slightly different if the transaction is one of a number of linked transactions. 
 The appropriate fraction is established using the formula: RC ÷ (TDC + TRC). 
 Where: 
 
 RC is the remaining consideration for the relevant transaction 
 TDC is the total dwellings consideration 
 TRC is the total remaining consideration 
 
 The total remaining consideration is, for a transaction that’s not one of a number of linked transactions, the remaining consideration. 
 You can use our  MDR calculator(https://www.gov.wales/calculate-land-transaction-tax-multiple-dwellings-relief)(https://www.gov.wales/calculate-land-transaction-tax-multiple-dwellings-relief)  to help work out how much LTT is payable with a claim for the relief. 
 Where the transaction is one of a number of linked transactions, the total remaining consideration is the total of the chargeable consideration for all the transaction, less the total dwellings consideration. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1: acquisition of dwellings and non-residential property 
 
 
   
 
 Ms E acquires the freehold to a 3 storey building from F Ltd. 
 The building consists of 2 flats on the upper 2 stories and an office on the ground floor. 
 Ms E owns her own home and neither flat is a replacement for that home. 
 The amounts given for the 2 flats are £300,000 and £250,000 respectively and £200,000 for the office, making a total consideration of £750,000. 
 The total chargeable consideration is £750,000. 
 The consideration attributable to dwellings is £550,000 (the £300,000 plus the £250,000 for the 2 flats). This is also the total dwellings consideration since there are no linked transactions. 
 The remaining consideration is £200,000 (the total chargeable consideration less the consideration attributable to dwellings). 
 The total dwellings is 2. 
 
 As the transaction is a mixed transaction, the non-residential rates may apply to the total consideration given, unless Ms E makes a claim to MDR. The LTT due, using the non-residential rates applicable on 22 December 2020, amounts to £25,250. 
 If Ms E makes a claim to MDR, her liability is calculated as follows. 
 The tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the total dwellings consideration divided by the total dwellings: £275,000 (£550,000 divided by 2). 
 The LTT due under the main residential property rates on £275,000 as of 10 October 2022 is £3,000. Multiplying this by the total dwellings gives £6,000 (£3,000 x 2). This is larger than 1% of the consideration attributable to dwellings, £5,500. So the tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the higher amount. 
 The tax related to the remaining consideration: 
 The tax due on the total chargeable consideration of a non-residential transaction (£750,000) would be £25,250. 
 Using the formula above the remaining consideration (£200,000) is divided by the total consideration (£750,000) giving a fraction of 4/15. Multiplying £25,250 by 4/15 gives an amount of tax of £6,733. 
 The total tax due in the event of a MDR claim is £7,000 plus £6,733, a total of £13,733. 
 Ms E has the choice of: 
 
 applying the non-residential rates to the total consideration for the transaction (LTT = £25,250), as this is a mixed use property, or 
 making a claim to MDR on the consideration attributable to the dwellings, at the main rates for residential properties, and then non-residential rates for the remaining consideration (LTT = £13,733)

 £300,000 for the 2 that are subject to leases of less than 21 years, and  
 £45,000 for the freehold reversion on the 3 flats let on leases of greater than 21 years, a total consideration of £345,000 
 
 
 The total chargeable consideration is £345,000. The consideration attributable to dwellings is £300,000 for the 2 flats subject to leases of 15 years. This is also the total dwellings consideration since there are no linked transactions. 
 The remaining consideration is £45,000 (the total chargeable consideration less the consideration attributable to dwellings). The total dwellings is 2. 
 The transaction consists of residential property, some of which is liable to the higher rates for higher rates residential property transactions, and some is liable at the main rates. 
 
 Ms E makes a claim to MDR, her liability is calculated as follows. 
 The tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the total dwellings consideration divided by the total dwellings - £150,000 (£300,000 divided by 2). 
 The LTT due under the higher rates rules on £150,000 is £6,000. Multiplying this by the total dwellings gives £12,000 (£6,000 x 2). This is larger than 1% of the consideration attributable to dwellings, £3,000 so the tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the higher amount. 
 The tax related to the remaining consideration: 
 The tax due on the total chargeable consideration of other residential property (if none was liable to the higher rates for higher rates residential property transactions) would be £7,200. 
 Using the formula above the remaining consideration (£45,000) is divided by the total consideration (£345,000), giving a fraction is 3/23. Multiplying £7,200 by 3/23 gives an amount of tax of £939. 
 The total tax due in the event of a multiple dwellings claim is £12,000 plus £939, a total of £12,939. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1: acquisition of dwellings and non-residential property 
 
 
   
 
 Ms E acquires the freehold to a 3 storey building from F Ltd. 
 The building consists of 2 flats on the upper 2 stories and an office on the ground floor. 
 Ms E owns her own home and neither flat is a replacement for that home. 
 The amounts given for the 2 flats are £300,000 and £250,000 respectively and £200,000 for the office, making a total consideration of £750,000. 
 The total chargeable consideration is £750,000. 
 The consideration attributable to dwellings is £550,000 (the £300,000 plus the £250,000 for the 2 flats). This is also the total dwellings consideration since there are no linked transactions. 
 The remaining consideration is £200,000 (the total chargeable consideration less the consideration attributable to dwellings). 
 The total dwellings is 2. 
 
 As the transaction is a mixed transaction, the non-residential rates may apply to the total consideration given, unless Ms E makes a claim to MDR. The LTT due, using the non-residential rates applicable on 22 December 2020, amounts to £25,250. 
 If Ms E makes a claim to MDR, her liability is calculated as follows. 
 The tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the total dwellings consideration divided by the total dwellings: £275,000 (£550,000 divided by 2). 
 The LTT due under the main residential property rates on £275,000 as of 10 October 2022 is £3,000. Multiplying this by the total dwellings gives £6,000 (£3,000 x 2). This is larger than 1% of the consideration attributable to dwellings, £5,500. So the tax related to the consideration attributable to dwellings is the higher amount. 
 The tax related to the remaining consideration: 
 The tax due on the total chargeable consideration of a non-residential transaction (£750,000) would be £25,250. 
 Using the formula above the remaining consideration (£200,000) is divided by the total consideration (£750,000) giving a fraction of 4/15. Multiplying £25,250 by 4/15 gives an amount of tax of £6,733. 
 The total tax due in the event of a MDR claim is £7,000 plus £6,733, a total of £13,733. 
 Ms E has the choice of: 
 
 applying the non-residential rates to the total consideration for the transaction (LTT = £25,250), as this is a mixed use property, or 
 making a claim to MDR on the consideration attributable to the dwellings, at the main rates for residential properties, and then non-residential rates for the remaining consideration (LTT = £13,733)

487,487,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Acquisitions involving multiple dwellings,LTTA/7042 Relief for transfers involving multiple dwellings: treatment of halls of residence," The definition of residential property provides that ‘residential accommodation for students’ other than ‘halls of residence for students in further or higher education’ is to be treated as a dwelling. Therefore:  
 
 a building (or part of a building) which is in use as residential accommodation for students, is used as a dwelling unless it is a hall of residence for students in further or higher education 
 a building (or part of a building) which is in use as a hall of residence for students in further or higher education is not used as a dwelling, regardless of its suitability for any other use 
 a building (or part of a building) which is not in use but is most suitable for use as residential accommodation for students (other than a hall of residence for students in further or higher education) is suitable for use as a dwelling, regardless of its suitability for any other use 
 a building (or part of a building) which is not in use but is most suitable for use as a hall of residence for students in further or higher education is not suitable for use as a dwelling, regardless of its suitability for any other use 
 a building (or part of a building) which is not in use but is equally suitable for use as residential accommodation for students or as a hall of residence is suitable for use as a dwelling 
 
 The term ‘residential accommodation for students’ refers in this context to purpose-built or adapted accommodation whose only or main purpose is the accommodation of students in further or higher education and which would not meet the normal criteria of suitability for residential use as a single dwelling. This would apply in cases where the accommodation has many of the usual characteristics of a dwelling or dwellings but where, for example, use as student accommodation is stipulated by planning permission and major interests in the individual units of accommodation cannot be acquired or disposed of separately. 
 For the purposes of multiple dwellings relief where student accommodation is treated as used or suitable for use as a dwelling, the extent of a single dwelling will be determined on normal principles. For example, in the case of a block of flats available only to students, where each flat consists of individual study bedrooms with communal kitchen and bathroom facilities, each flat within the block will be treated as used, or suitable for use, as a single dwelling. However, each study within that flat will not constitute a separate dwelling.

493,493,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Social housing,LTTA/7055 Right to buy relief," (paragraph 2) 
 A right to buy transaction is defined as either: 
 
 the sale of a dwelling at a discount (or the grant of a lease of a dwelling at a discount) by a relevant public sector body, or 
 the sale of a dwelling (or the grant of a lease of a dwelling) pursuant to a preserved right to buy. 
 
 Relevant public sector bodies for this relief for LTT purposes are: 
 
 a Minister of the Crown 
 the Welsh Ministers 
 a local housing authority within the meaning in section 1 of the Housing Act 1985 
 a registered social landlord 
 a housing action trust established under Part 3 of the Housing Act 1988 
 a local policing body within the meaning of Section 101(1) of the Police Act 1996 
 a person specified for the purposes of this relief in regulations made by the Welsh Ministers 
 
 In relation to the sale of a dwelling or the grant of a lease of a dwelling made in pursuance of a preserved right to buy the seller is a person against whom the right to buy under Part 5 of the Housing Act 1985 is exercisable by virtue of section 171A of that Act. The buyer is the qualifying person with the preserved right to buy and the dwelling is the qualifying-dwelling house in relation to the buyer. 
 The relief is through the provision of alternative methods of calculating the chargeable consideration. 
 In the case of a right to buy transaction, the rules relating to contingent consideration do not apply in relation to any discount provided by the seller. Therefore the chargeable consideration does not include any consideration payable if a contingency (for example the need to pay the discounted amount to the seller) were to occur. 
 In a right to buy transaction, where the seller is a registered social landlord, any purchase grants provided by the Welsh Ministers under section 20 or 21 of the Housing Act 1996 in respect of the disposal at a discount by the registered social landlord are not included in the calculation of the chargeable consideration. 
 The Abolition of the Right to Buy and Associated Rights (Wales) Act 2018 will end the right to buy, preserved right to buy and the right to acquire for tenants of local authorities and registered social landlords. For new homes these rights ended 2 months after the Bill received Royal Assent. For existing housing stock final abolition will take place at least one year after Royal Assent (see  gov.wales(http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en) )

494,494,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Social housing,LTTA/7056 Shared ownership leases," (paragraphs 3 to 9) 
 Shared ownership lease – election for market value treatment where freehold interest can be acquired 
 (paragraph 3, 4 and 7). 
 The term “shared ownership lease” is not defined in the LTT legislation. 
 In order to benefit from the specific rules for an election for market value treatment, all of the following conditions must be met. The lease must: 
 
 be granted either by a qualifying body or in pursuance of a preserved right to buy 
 be of a dwelling 
 give the lessee/tenant (or lessees/tenants) exclusive use of the dwelling 
 provide that the lessee can acquire the reversion 
 be granted partly in consideration of rent and partly in consideration of a premium, and that the premium is calculated by reference to the market value of the dwelling or a sum calculated by reference to that value 
 contain a statement of the market value of the dwelling or the sum calculated by reference to that value 
 
 The taxpayer must also make a valid election for the market value rule to apply to the acquisition. 
 A taxpayer may make an election so that the chargeable consideration for the grant of the lease is the market value of the dwelling stated in the lease and no account is taken of the rents (as contingent consideration or otherwise). Furthermore, the usual rules for the establishment of the market value of the property as set out in section 70 LTTA do not apply. 
 For the election for this treatment to be valid, it must be made to the WRA at the same time as the return (by claiming the relevant relief code in the return). The election cannot be withdrawn or amended once made. However, if necessary the election can be notified to the WRA in an amended return. 
 The chargeable consideration on the grant of the lease is to be treated as if it is not linked to any staircasing transaction or to the transfer of the reversion. 
 When the reversion of the lease is transferred to the tenant that chargeable interest is relieved from tax so long as the election was made and any tax chargeable in respect of the grant of the lease has been paid in full. In the absence of a valid election, the reversion will not be relieved from tax and any LTT arising on that transaction would be payable. 
 Shared ownership lease – election for market value where freehold interest cannot be acquired 
 (paragraph 5 and 7) 
 Relief is also available for the acquisition of shared ownership leases where there cannot be an acquisition by the lessee/tenant of the freehold, for example the acquisition of a flat in a block of flats. 
 In order to benefit from the specific rules for an election for market value treatment, all of the following conditions must be met. The lease must: 
 
 be granted either by a qualifying body or in pursuance of a preserved right to buy 
 be of a dwelling 
 give the lessee/tenant (or lessees/tenants) exclusive use of the dwelling 
 provide that the lessee/tenant (or lessees/tenants), on payment of a sum, may require the terms of the lease to be altered so that the rent payable under the lease is reduced 
 be granted partly in consideration of rent and partly in consideration of a premium, and that the premium is calculated by reference to the premium that would have been obtainable in the open market for a lease granted on the same terms, other than the amount of rent that should be the minimum payable and not the actual rents payable, or a sum calculated by reference to that premium 
 contain a statement of the minimum rent and of the premium obtainable in the open market or the sum calculated by reference to that premium 
 
 The effect of these rules is that in the event that an election is made, the chargeable consideration will be the amount of premium that would be payable in the event that no rents other than the minimum rents (for example, ground rents) were payable. The amount of chargeable consideration will therefore represent the open market value of the premium, rather than the actual premium paid and the value of any rents payable. 
 The taxpayer must make a valid election for the open market rule to apply to the acquisition. 
 A taxpayer may make an election so that the chargeable consideration for the grant of the lease is the market value of the premium stated in the lease and no account is taken of the rents (as contingent consideration or otherwise). Furthermore, the usual rules for the establishment of the market value of the property as set out in section 70 LTTA do not apply. 
 For the election for this treatment to be valid, it must be made to the WRA at the same time as the return (by claiming the relevant relief code in the return). The election cannot be withdrawn or amended once made. However, if necessary the election can be notified to the WRA on an amended return. 
 The chargeable consideration on the grant of the lease is to be treated as if it is not linked to any future staircasing transaction. 
 Shared ownership lease - staircasing transactions 
 (paragraph 6) 
 When buying a home through a shared ownership lease (be that where a freehold reversion is possible or not), a taxpayer may be able to buy additional shares or interests in the property (commonly known as staircasing). 
 A staircasing transaction will occur where a lessee/tenant has the right, on payment of a sum of money, to require the terms of the lease to be varied so that the rent payable is reduced, and that by doing so the lessee/tenant acquires and additional interest in the property over that already owned. For a property with a freehold reversion this will mean that the lessee/tenant acquires an increased interest in the freehold, and for a leasehold property that the terms of the lease are changed to reflect the further premium paid. 
 If an election is made then any staircasing transactions are relieved from tax, subject to a claim, if any tax payable on the first transaction has been paid. 
 If no election has been made then the transaction is relieved from charge, subject to a claim, if the total interest held by the lessee/tenant does not exceed 80% of the interest subject to the shared ownership lease. Once the interest owned by the lessee/tenant is, or exceeds 80%, the lessee/tenant‘s return cannot include a claim for relief and must include a self assessment of any tax payable. 
 For residential leases rent is not chargeable consideration. This means that where a taxpayer enters into a shared ownership lease without an intention to increase their share or interest in the property they may achieve a more favourable tax position by choosing to be charged LTT on the premium they pay, rather than making a market value election. As stated above, an election cannot be withdrawn once it has been made, however, if necessary it can be made to the WRA in an amended return. 
 If the staircasing transaction is not notifiable then no return needs to be made to the WRA. When the staircasing transaction is notifiable a return must be made and relief claimed. 
 Shared ownership leases – no election 
 The grant of the lease and all staircasing transactions - including those which are relieved from charge are ‘linked transactions’. 
 The LTT chargeable on staircasing transactions above 80% is determined by the total consideration given for all the linked transactions. 
 If the staircasing transaction does not take the lessee/tenants interest to 80% or greater, if the transaction is not notifiable, no return needs to be made to the WRA. When the staircasing transaction results in the lessee/tenant owning an interest of 80% or greater, a return must be made using the linked transactions rules. 
 Rent to shared ownership lease – charge to tax 
 (paragraph 8) 
 A rent to shared ownership lease scheme means a scheme under which a person or persons is granted an occupation contract of a dwelling by a qualifying body and subsequently that qualifying body grants a shared ownership lease of the dwelling to the same person or persons. 
 An occupation contract has the meaning given in Part 2 of the Renting Home(https://www.gov.wales/)(https://www.gov.wales(http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en)/)(https://www.gov.wales(http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en)/)s (Wales) Act 2016. 
 Transactions between the qualifying body and the person or persons (or any of them) under these schemes are not treated as linked transactions. 
 This includes: 
 
 the grant of the occupation contract, 
 the grant of a shared ownership lease, and 
 any other land transaction (e.g. an option) entered into as part of the scheme 
 
 The person or persons’ possession of the dwelling under the occupation contract is disregarded in determining the effective date of the grant of the shared ownership lease. This means that even if the person takes possession under an occupation contract after contracts are exchanged but before the shared ownership lease is granted, the effective date will still be the date on which the shared ownership lease is granted. Therefore the substantial performance rules are not triggered in any event if the person already occupies the property under an occupation contract when contracts for the shared ownership lease are exchanged.

496,496,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Social housing,LTTA/7058 Shared ownership trusts," (Paragraphs 10 to 17) 
 Relief, through the provision of rules that provide for the consideration given for specified shared ownership and rent to shared ownership schemes involving shared ownership trusts, are to be calculated differently from the primary rules for LTT. 
 Shared ownership trust: meaning 
 (paragraph 10 and 11) 
 A shared ownership trust is a trust of land, within the meaning of section 1 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, which meets the following conditions: 
 
 the trust property is a dwelling in Wales 
 one of the beneficiaries of the trust must be a qualifying body (‘the social landlord’) 
 the terms of the trust must:
	 
 provide for one or more individual beneficiaries (‘the buyer’) to have exclusive use of the trust property as their only or main residence 
 require the buyer to make an initial payment (‘the initial capital’) to the social landlord 
 require the buyer to make additional payments (‘rent-equivalent payments’) to the social landlord by way of compensation under section 13(6)(a) Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 
 enable the buyer to make other additional payments (“equity-acquisition payments”) to the social landlord 
 determine the initial beneficial interests of the social landlord and the buyer by reference to the initial capital 
 specify a sum, equating or relating to the market value of the dwelling, by reference to which the initial capital is calculated, and 
 provide for the buyer’s beneficial interest in the property to increase, and the social landlord’s to diminish (or be extinguished) as equity-acquisition payments are made 
 
 
 
 For shared ownership trusts a ‘dwelling’ includes: 
 
 a building which is being constructed or adapted for use as a dwelling 
 land which is to be used for the purpose of the construction of a dwelling, and 
 land which is, or is to become, the garden or grounds of a dwelling 
 
 For shared ownership trusts a ‘qualifying body’ is: 
 
 a local housing authority within the meaning given by section 1 of the Housing Act 1985 
 a housing association within the meaning given in the Housing Associations Act 1985, or 
 a housing action trust established under Part 3 of the Housing Act 1988 
 
 For shared ownership trusts ‘the buyer’ is: 
 
 the individual(s) identified as the buyer under the conditions for this relief, and not the social landlord or any other beneficiary, is to be treated as the buyer(s) of the trust property 
 
 Furthermore, the usual rules for the establishment of the market value of the property as set out in section 70 LTTA do not apply. 
 Shared ownership trusts: election for market value treatment 
 (paragraph 12) 
 The buyer acquiring an interest in a dwelling held under a shared ownership trust, may make a market value election similar to that for a shared ownership lease. 
 As the rules provide that the definition of market value in section 70 is not used for this relief, the market value should be computed on a vacant possession basis. 
 The election is irrevocable, therefore, once it is made it cannot be changed, even by an amendment (or further amendment) to the return. 
 The election is made in the land transaction return submitted in respect of the declaration of the shared ownership trust by showing the market value as the consideration and entering the relevant relief code. However, if necessary the election can be notified to the WRA in an amended return. 
 The effect of a valid election is that: 
 
 the chargeable consideration for the declaration of the shared ownership trust is the sum specified in the terms of the trust, equating or relating to the market value of the dwelling, by reference to which the initial capital is calculated, and  
 no account is taken of rent-equivalent payments 
 
 Shared ownership trust: staircasing transactions and transfer upon termination 
 (paragraph 13 and 14) 
 Provided that a valid election has been made and any tax chargeable in respect of the declaration of the shared ownership trust has been paid: 
 
 equity-acquisition payments (‘staircasing‘), and the consequent increases in the purchaser’s beneficial interest, and 
 the transfer to the purchaser of an interest in the trust property on termination of the trust 
 
 are relieved from charge. 
 Shared ownership trust: treatment additional payments where no election made 
 (paragraph 14, 15 and 16 ) 
 If the buyer does not make a market value election, LTT on the declaration of a shared ownership trust is charged on the basis that the initial capital is treated as consideration other than rent and rent-equivalent payments are treated as payments of rent. 
 Equity-acquisition payments and the consequent increases in the purchaser’s beneficial interest, are relieved from charge if, following the increase, the buyer’s beneficial interest does not exceed 80% of the total beneficial interest in the trust property. 
 Such payments and consequential increases are chargeable to LTT if, following the increase: 
 
 the buyer’s beneficial interest exceeds 80% of the total beneficial interest in the trust property, or 
 an interest in the trust property is transferred to the buyer on termination of the trust. 
 
 For the purpose of determining the amount of tax chargeable on the declaration of a shared ownership trust, the declaration is treated as if it were not linked to: 
 
 any equity-acquisition payment or any consequent increase in the purchaser’s beneficial interest in the trust property, or 
 a transfer to the purchaser of an interest in the trust property on termination of the trust 
 
 An equity acquisition payment, where no election has been made, is relieved from tax if following the increase in the buyer’s beneficial interest that interest does not exceed 80% of the total beneficial interest in the trust property 
 If the staircasing transaction, does not take the lessee/tenants interest to 80% or greater, then if the transaction is not notifiable no return needs to be made to the WRA. When the staircasing transaction (or on the beneficial interest on termination of the trust transfers to the buyer) results in them owning an interest of 80% or greater, then a return must be made using the linked transactions rules. 
 Rent to shared ownership trust; charge to tax 
 (paragraph 17) 
 A ‘rent to shared ownership trust scheme’ means a scheme under which a person or persons may become a beneficiary (‘the buyer’) under a shared ownership trust with a qualifying body (‘the social landlord’) and that body grants to the person or persons an occupation contract of the dwelling to that person or persons.  
 An occupation contract has the meaning given in Part 2 of the Renting Home(https://www.gov.wales/)(https://www.gov.wales(http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en)/)(https://www.gov.wales(http://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en)/)s (Wales) Act 2016. 
 Transactions between the qualifying body and the person or persons (or any of them) under these schemes are not treated as linked transactions. This includes: 
 
 the grant of the occupation contract 
 the grant of a shared ownership lease, and 
 any other land transaction (e.g. an option) entered into as part of the scheme 
 
 The person or persons’ possession of the dwelling under the occupation contract is disregarded in determining the effective date for the declaration of the shared ownership trust. This means that even if the person takes possession under an occupation contract, as part of the rent to shared ownership trust scheme, but before the shared ownership trust is declared, the effective date will still be the date on which the trust is declared. Therefore the substantial performance rules are not triggered in any event if the person already occupies the property under an occupation contract when the shared ownership trust scheme arrangements are agreed or put in place.

497,497,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Social housing,LTTA/7059 Rent to mortgage," (paragraph 18) 
 A rent to mortgage transaction means: 
 
 the transfer of a dwelling to a person 
 the grant of a lease of a dwelling to a person 
 
 where that person is exercising a right to acquire on rent to mortgage terms under Part 5 of the Housing Act 1985. 
 The chargeable consideration for the transaction is the price that would be payable for: 
 
 the transfer of the dwelling to the person (where the transaction is a transfer) 
 the grant of a lease of the dwelling to the person (where the transaction is the grant of the lease) 
 
 calculated in accordance with Section 126 of the Housing Act 1985 as it applies to rent to mortgage transactions. 
 The relief is therefore through the provision of an alternative method of calculating the chargeable consideration.

498,498,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Social housing,LTTA/7060 Relief for certain acquisitions by registered social landlords," (paragraph 19) 
 Relief is available for a land transaction where the buyer is a registered social landlord, and one of the following conditions are met: 
 
 the registered social landlord is controlled by its tenants 
 the seller is a qualifying body, or 
 the transaction is funded with the assistance of a public subsidy 
 
 A registered social landlord is controlled by its tenants if the majority of the board members are tenants occupying properties owned or managed by the registered social landlord. 
 For this relief a board member is: 
 
 if it is a company, a director of the company 
 if it is a body corporate whose affairs are managed by its members, one of those members 
 if it is a body of trustees, one of those trustees, or 
 otherwise, a member of the management committee or other body which is entrusted with the management of the registered social landlord 
 
 The transaction does not have to be fully funded with the subsidy. However, for this relief to apply, the public subsidy must be in the form of any grant or financial assistance: 
 
 made or given by way of a distribution under Section 25 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 
 made by the Welsh Ministers under Section 18 of the Housing Act 1996 (social housing grants), or 
 under Section 126 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (financial assistance for regeneration and development) 
 
 For this relief a qualifying body is: 
 
 a registered social landlord 
 a housing action trust established under Part 3 of the Housing Act 1988 
 a county or county borough council constituted under section 21 of the Local Government Act 1972 
 a county or district council constituted under Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1972, or 
 the Welsh Ministers 
 
 Relief, when claimed, is equal to the LTT which would otherwise be payable.

 (Schedule 12) 
 Where the following 3 conditions are met, relief from LTT may be claimed on a land transaction which transfers a chargeable interest from a person (the transferor) to a limited liability partnership in connection with its incorporation. 
 A limited liability partnership means one formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. It should be noted that the transitional provisions contained in Schedule 2 to the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009 ensure that a limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 is to be treated as if it was incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2000. 
 The 3 conditions are: 
 
 condition A – that the effective date of the land transaction is within the period of one year from the date of incorporation of the limited liability partnership 
 condition B – that at the relevant time the seller:
	 
 is a partner in a partnership comprised of all the persons who are (or are to be) members of the limited liability partnership (and no-one else), or 
 holds the chargeable interest transferred as nominee or bare trustee for one or more or the partners in such a partnership 
 
 
 condition C – that the proportions of the interests held by the partners:
	 
 are the same both before and after the transaction, or 
 where they are different, the differences have not arisen as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose (or one of the main purposes) of which, is the avoidance of liability to any duty or tax 
 
 
 
 For the purposes of this relief ‘relevant time’ means: 
 
 if the transferor acquired the chargeable interest after the partnership was incorporated, the time immediately after they acquired that chargeable interest, or  
 otherwise, immediately before the partnership was incorporated

 Relief is available for certain transactions where one of 3 different sets of alternative property finance arrangements is in place: 
 
 where a financial institution buys a property, then leases or sub-leases it to a person and agrees that at the end of that term it will transfer the property to that person; 
 where a financial institution and a person purchase a property as beneficial tenants in common; or 
 where a financial institution purchases a property and re-sells it to a person, the person borrows some or all of the purchase price from the financial institution and grants a mortgage to the financial institution over that property

 a financial institution purchases, or leases, a property, whether that is a major interest or an undivided share of a major interest; 
 if the interest acquired by the financial institution is an undivided share, the major interest must be held by the financial institution and the person as beneficial tenants in common; 
 the property is leased, or sub-leased, to the person; and 
 there are agreements in place that at the end of the term of the alternative finance arrangements for the whole of the interest purchased by the financial institution in the property , to be transferred to the person 
 
 Under the arrangement there may also be provision for shares in the property to be transferred to the person in stages during the term. 
 Provided that certain conditions are met, the lease, the transfer of the property and any intermediate transfers of undivided shares in the property are relieved from tax. By providing these reliefs, the tax payable will be the same as would be payable had a typical interest bearing mortgage product is used to fund the purchase. 
 The initial purchase (called the ‘first transaction’ in the legislation) of the property will generally be chargeable (as would be the case where a person buys a property with a typical interest bearing mortgage product). However, if the seller is the person or a financial institution which already held the property under the above type of arrangements with the person, the initial purchase is also relieved. This relief is provided so that tax is not payable as would be the case for a typical interest bearing re-mortgage product. 
 The alternative property finance arrangements will require the person to be granted a lease out of the interest owned by the financial institution. This transaction formalises the occupation of the property by the person. It also creates the income stream for the financial institution (in the form of rents) and for the person to make capital payments to the financial institution in order to reduce the amount of funding provided by the financial institution (if reduction in this manner is part of the arrangements). This transaction where the person acquires a lease from the financial institution is called the ‘second’ transaction in the legislation. 
 At the end of, or during the period the arrangements are in force, the interest owned by the financial institution may be transferred from the financial institution to the person. This transaction, or series of transactions, is relieved from LTT. These transactions are called a ‘further transaction’ in the legislation. 
 Relief for the second transaction may only be claimed if the provisions of the LTTA and the TCMA have been complied with in relation to the first transaction. Likewise, relief for a further transaction may only be claimed if the provisions of the LTTA and the TCMA have been complied with in relation to the first and second transaction. 
 Further transactions are not to be treated: 
 
 as substantially performed unless and until the final transaction is entered into (thus dis-applying the rules about substantial performance); or 
 as the grant of an option under the rules about options and rights of pre-emption in section 15 of LTTA 
 
 This ensures that, in the event that there are a number of further transactions that each one does not need to be notified to the WRA, but the final transaction that transfers the interest (or the remaining interest) held by the financial institution to the person is potentially notifiable. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 Mr and Mrs A wish to purchase their new home and to fund the purchase through an alternative property finance arrangement. They have a deposit of £50,000 and have identified a house they wish to buy for £200,000. They have already had their funding arrangements approved by a financial institution (‘FI’) that provides alternative property finance. Mr and Mrs A inform FI of the property they wish to purchase. FI and Mr and Mrs A are tenants in common. 
 As the acquisition is from a person other than Mr and Mrs A, there is no relief on the first transaction. 
 The terms of the arrangement require FI to grant Mr and Mrs A a lease which provides that they may have exclusive enjoyment of the property. Relief is available on this second transaction. 
 The lease provides that Mr and Mrs A will pay rent monthly. That rent includes an amount that provides a profit element for FI and also that reduces FI’s interest in the property. Each month therefore, there is a further transaction reflecting the transfer of a small part of FI’s interest to Mr and Mrs A. Each of these transactions is not a notifiable transaction until the final such transfer which will be a notifiable transaction. That final further transaction is notifiable and reflects the fact that FI no longer has an interest in the property.

 Mrs B transfers an interest in the property worth £100,000 to FI. FI and Mrs B are now are tenants in common. As the acquisition by FI is from ‘the person; (Mrs B) relief is available to FI on that first transaction. 
 The terms of the arrangement require FI to grant Mrs B a lease which provides that she may have exclusive enjoyment of the property. Relief is available on this second transaction. 
 The lease provides that Mrs B will pay rent monthly. That rent includes an amount that provides a profit element for FI and also that reduces FI’s interest in the property.

504,504,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative property finance reliefs,LTTA/7019 Alternative property finance relief where land is sold to a financial institution and re-sold to a person," Relief is available where a financial institution buys a property and sells it to a person, and that person grants a legal mortgage over that property in favour of the financial institution. 
 There are 2 land transactions taking place under these arrangements; the combined effect of the reliefs is to bring the LTT on the acquisition using these arrangements, in line with that payable on a purchase financed with a typical interest bearing mortgage product. 
 For this relief to be claimed, arrangements must be entered into between a person and a financial institution as follows: 
 
 the financial institution purchases a major interest in land or an undivided share in a major interest; 
 the institution sells that interest to the person, that is the institution sells the whole of the major interest or undivided share it obtained to the person; and 
 the person grants the financial institution a mortgage over that interest 
 
 The first transaction (the purchase of a major interest in land by the financial institution) will generally be chargeable to LTT but relief may be claimed by the financial institution if the seller is: 
 
 the person who enters into the arrangements; or 
 another financial institution by whom the interest was acquired under arrangements described above and the arrangements were entered into between it and the person 
 
 Relief from LTT may be claimed on the sale of the property by the financial institution to the person, if all the requirements relating to the first transaction have been complied with. This includes payment of any LTT due on the first transaction. This is because the person obtaining the funding from the financial institution will effectively have already paid LTT on the purchase of the property either before the transfer to the financial institution or at the point of purchase by the financial institution from a third party seller. 
 Where the replacement of main residence rules are met following a transaction subject to higher rates, it is the financial institution that must make the claim to repayment of the higher rates portion of the transaction by amending the tax return accordingly, rather than the person obtaining the funding from the financial institution. This is because it is the financial institution that filed the return, rather than the individual, and it is the financial institution that paid the devolved tax and so may make a claim for repayment. See our guidance at  LTTA/8090(/higher-rates-purchases-residential-property-technical-guidance#5225)  on the rules on replacement of main residences.

He has a deposit of £30,000 and has identified a house he wishes to buy for £250,000. He already has his funding arrangements approved by an FI that provides alternative property finance and he informed FI of the property he wishes to purchase. 
 The arrangements are such that the property is acquired for £250,000 from the third party seller. The purchase is funded using £30,000 deposit from Mr A and £220,000 funding from FI. 
 As the acquisition is from a person other than Mr A there is no relief on the first transaction. 
 The property is then sold to Mr A by FI for £300,000 payable in 300 monthly instalments (25 years). A legal charge is held over the property by FI. Relief is available on this second transaction.

505,505,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative property finance reliefs,LTTA/7020 Situations when relief cannot be claimed," (paragraphs 5 and 6 schedule 10) 
 Relief may not be claimed where the following apply or could apply: 
 
 group relief, reconstruction relief or acquisition relief must not be available for the first transaction (even if the relief has been withdrawn);  
 the alternative property finance arrangements must not involve arrangements or any connected arrangements for someone to acquire control of the financial institution even if the arrangements are conditional; 
 all the requirements relating to the first transaction and the second transaction are not complied with, including payment of any LTT due on the first transaction; 
 at anytime following the grant of the lease (or sub-lease) (the second transaction) and the further transactions either the financial institution did not hold the interest acquired by the first transaction and the person did not must hold the lease (or sub-lease) granted by the financial institution in the second transaction

506,506,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative property finance reliefs,LTTA/7021 Interest held by financial institution to be treated as an exempt interest," (paragraph 7 Schedule 10) 
 An interest held by a financial institution as a result of the ‘first transaction’ (the acquisition of a major interest in land or an undivided share in a major interest by the financial institution) is an exempt interest. Any transfer of that interest therefore incurs no LTT and is not notifiable to the WRA. This permits an interest held by the financial institution to be transferred to another financial institution where the same alternative property finance arrangements are in place, providing the users and providers of such arrangements with similar tax treatment to when a person moves from one interest bearing mortgage product to another with a different lender. 
 This rule does not, however, make either the first transaction itself or any further transactions, a land transaction involving an exempt interest. Relief will be available for these transactions, but the transactions remain notifiable to the WRA. 
 The interest ceases to be an exempt interest if: 
 
 the lease or sub-lease (the second transaction) ceases to have effect, for example the termination point is reached or the lease is terminated early; or 
 the further transaction (the right of a person to require the institution to transfer the major interest purchased by the institution under the first transaction) ceases to have effect or is subject to a restriction

509,509,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Open-ended investment company reliefs,LTTA/7089 Relief from Land Transaction Tax: conversion of an authorised unit trust to an open-ended investment company," (paragraph 1 of Schedule 19) 
 A land transaction where a property that is subject to the trusts of an authorised unit trust is transferred to an open-ended investment company, may be relieved from tax if the necessary conditions are met. 
 The authorised unit trust is referred to as the ‘target trust’ and the open-ended investment company as the ‘acquiring company’. 
 The relevant conditions are that:

513,513,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7095 Compulsory purchase relief," (paragraph 1 Schedule 21) 
 Relief may be claimed where land is purchased following the making of a compulsory purchase order for the purpose of facilitating development. The person claiming relief can only be a person who is able to, and has made, a compulsory purchase order in relation to the main subject matter of the land transaction. 
 A typical scenario is where a local authority is supporting a major development which requires the purchase of properties by the developer. The developer will usually attempt to acquire the properties and land required by negotiation with the landowners, but sometimes agreement cannot be reached. 
 The developer will then agree with the local authority for them to make a compulsory purchase order. 
 Once a compulsory purchase order is obtained, the developer may continue with negotiations but should these negotiations fail, the local authority may purchase the land by way of the compulsory purchase order and subsequently sell the land to the developer. 
 As there are 2 acquisitions, one from the landowner to the local authority and one from the local authority to the developer, there would normally be 2 LTT chargeable transactions.

514,514,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7096 Conditions for relief," The rules give the local authority relief from LTT on the first purchase, provided the conditions for relief are met. Those conditions are provided by the definition of ‘a compulsory purchase facilitating development’. 
 Such a compulsory purchase occurs where the purchase of a chargeable interest is by way of a compulsory purchase order made by the buyer (for example a local authority) to facilitate development by a third party. The relief is only available where a party other than a local authority develops the land. If the developer is the local authority, there is no relief. 
 In order to obtain relief, the buyer must be the person who made the compulsory purchase order. This would usually be the local planning authority. 
 Any subsequent transfer of the chargeable interest to the third party is subject to LTT in the normal way.

515,515,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7097 Effected by agreement," As long as the other conditions are fulfilled, it does not matter if the purchase is part of an agreement between the seller and the third party. 
 Should the landowner, as seller, agree to sell the land and there is agreement of a price with the third party (developer), as long as the subsequent sale, to the maker of the compulsory purchase order, is the subject of a compulsory purchase order, the fact that there is already an agreement as to terms, is not a bar to the local authority obtaining the relief on its land transaction as buyer. 
 In the event that the land is sold directly from the original landowner to the third party no relief can be claimed as the local authority is not the buyer.

516,516,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7098 Development by third party," The purchase must be made to facilitate development of the land by a third party (that is, someone other than the person making the compulsory purchase order). The term development has the same meaning as in Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

517,517,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7099 Planning obligations relief," (paragraph 2 Schedule 21) 
 Where a land transaction is undertaken to comply with a planning obligation or a modification of a planning obligation, the buyer (a public body as defined) may claim relief from LTT on that transaction, if certain conditions are fulfilled. 
 This relief is designed to relieve a developer from a potential double charge where they have entered into planning obligations in the course of a development. 
 It is common for a planning authority to require the developer to enter into planning obligations (for example, to build a new road or school or to make a financial contribution) as a condition of the granting of planning permission for a development. 
 Where the obligations require extra building works, as opposed to a financial contribution, the developer will not usually want to retain that facility once it is finished. They will usually want to transfer it to a public authority to run from then on (for example, if a road is built the developer may transfer it to the highways department of a county council). 
 If the developer acquires the land from its original owner and when the building is completed, transfers it on to a public body, the developer may be subject to an effective ‘double charge’. 
 This ‘double charge’ arises as although the public body will be liable for any LTT on the latter transaction, it will usually seek reimbursement from the developer, as part of the arrangements for the granting of planning permission. 
 By claiming the relief, the public body is relieved from the LTT charge on the actual land transaction in which it acquires the land, buildings or facility, so effectively relieving the developer from a ‘double charge’.

518,518,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/7100 The conditions for relief," All 3 of the following conditions must be fulfilled in order for the transfer from the developer to the public body to be eligible for relief. 
 Enforceable against seller 
 The first condition is that the planning obligation must be enforceable (through the courts or by another mechanism) against the vendor. 
 This means that there must be a planning obligation in place against the vendor before the transaction is effected. Additionally that planning obligation must be capable of being enforced, whether through the courts or by other means. It does not matter that no action has been taken to enforce the planning order it must though have been made and therefore be capable of being enforced. 
 Therefore, transfers from the developer to the public body without this condition in the planning permission are not transfers in order to comply with an obligation, as there is nothing to with which to comply and relief cannot therefore be claimed. 
 Purchaser is a public body 
 The second condition is that the purchaser is a public body. 
 5 year time limit 
 The final condition is that the transaction takes place within 5 years of the date the planning obligation was entered into or modified. It is the latest of these dates from which the time period runs. 
 For example, if the planning obligation was entered into on 1 March 2020 and subsequently modified on 20 September 2022 and modified again on 25 June 2023 and then became the subject of a compulsory purchase order, the land transaction transferring to the property from the developer to the public body must take place by 24 June 2028 at the latest. This is the last date which is within the period of five years commencing with the date of the last modification (that is within 5 years from 25 June 2023).

519,519,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Compulsory purchase relief and planning obligations relief,LTTA/101 Definitions," Planning obligation and modification of a planning obligation 
 A planning obligation is defined as one within the meaning of Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which is entered into in accordance with subsection 9 of that section.  
 A modification of planning obligation is defined as a modification mentioned in Section 106A(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

525,525,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Sale and leaseback relief, ," LTTA/7016 Sale and leaseback relief 
 (schedule 9) 
  
Sale and leaseback transactions involve a buyer agreeing to purchase a major-interest (freehold or leasehold) in land or buildings from a seller, then that same buyer granting a lease or sub-lease of the land or buildings, or part of them, back to the seller who then becomes the tenant. Both the sale transaction and leaseback transaction are chargeable for LTT. However, subject to certain conditions, sale and leaseback relief provides for the leaseback transaction to be relieved from LTT. Where this relief applies, the sale transaction remains chargeable to LTT. 
 For sale and leaseback relief to apply to the leaseback transaction, all of the following conditions must be met: 
 
 the sale transaction must be entered into wholly or partly in consideration of the leaseback transaction 
 where the sale transaction is partly in consideration of the leaseback transaction, any other consideration for the sale transaction is the payment of money (in any currency) or the assumption, satisfaction or release of debt 
 that the sale transaction is not a transfer of rights to a third party or a pre-completion transaction, and 
 where both parties are bodies corporate at the effective date of the leaseback transaction, they are not members of the same group for the purposes of LTT group relief. 
 
 The sale and leaseback relief is available for both residential and non-residential transactions. 
 Sale and leaseback relief is available only where the same parties are involved in both transactions. For example, where ‘A’ transfers a property to ‘B’, then ‘B’ leases the property back to ‘A’, ‘A’ must remain the same in both transactions. ‘A’ may be made up of more than 1 person, but if any of these people change between the sale and leaseback transactions, the relief does not apply. 
 There is no particular requirement for a leaseback transaction to be in consideration of only 1 sale transaction, or for 1 sale transaction to be in consideration of only 1 leaseback transaction for the relief to apply. 
 The amount of chargeable consideration for the sale transaction will depend upon whether there was a written agreement, at the time of the sale transaction, for the leaseback transaction to be entered into. If there was, the chargeable consideration for the sale transaction should take this encumbrance into account (see example 3 below). 
 If there is no such agreement, the chargeable consideration for the sale transaction will be based on the unencumbered interest in land (i.e. the value would ignore the leasehold transaction). It should be noted that such an encumbrance may increase, decrease or have no impact on the value when compared to the unencumbered value given that rent may be payable on the leaseback transaction, which would be an income stream for the lessor, as part of the sale and leaseback arrangement.

526,526,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Sale and leaseback relief, ," A Ltd owns a leasehold interest in a commercial property. To raise finance it decides to assign its lease to an unconnected B Ltd in consideration of £1m (the ‘sale transaction’) and a leaseback at market rent of the ground floor only (the ‘leaseback transaction’). 
 Sale and leaseback relief applies to the leaseback transaction as the relevant conditions are met in this example as follows: 
 
 the sale transaction (transfer by A Ltd) is partly in consideration of the leaseback transaction by B Ltd of part of the property transferred, so is an interest granted out of the interest acquired by B Ltd 
 the only other consideration for the transaction is the payment of money 
 the sale is not a contracted transfer of rights to a third party or a pre-completion transaction, and  
 the companies are not connected for LTT group relief purposes. 
 
 Therefore the new sub-lease acquired by A Ltd under the leaseback transaction is relieved from tax. 
 The sale transaction, assignment of the original lease to B Ltd, is chargeable to LTT in accordance with the rules for exchanges on its market value as encumbered by the new sub-lease. As B Ltd is unconnected, it would be expected that the consideration will, at a minimum, amount to the £1m it was prepared to pay in cash for the sale encumbered by the lease. However, it is also possible that there will be a profit element associated with the head-lease as there is an income stream arising from the new sub-lease acquired by B Ltd, in the form of rents payable by A Ltd. When considering the market value of the encumbered interest acquired from A Ltd that income stream will also need to be considered.

527,527,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Sale and leaseback relief, ," D Ltd owns a leasehold interest in a commercial property. To raise finance it decides to assign its lease to company E Ltd in consideration of £1m (the ‘sale transaction’) and a leaseback at market rent of the ground floor only (the ‘leaseback transaction’). In this example both D Ltd & E Ltd are 100% subsidiaries of C Ltd. 
 Sale and leaseback relief is not available in this example as one of the conditions is not met - as the companies are in the same group, they are connected for the purposes of LTT group relief at the time of the transaction. Therefore both the sale transaction (the assignment of the head-lease) and the leaseback transaction (new sub-lease) are both chargeable transactions based on the market value of each interest acquired. However, group relief may be available for both elements of the transaction if the conditions in Schedule 16 to LTTA are met.

528,528,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Sale and leaseback relief, ," Individual Ms F owns a freehold property which she wishes to convert into 2 commercial units. To enable her to raise finance, she is required to create leasehold interests in the property. G Ltd is set up by Ms F. Ms F transfers the freehold interest to G Ltd who in turn grants two 999 year leases back to Ms F at no premium and a peppercorn rent. Ms F is then able to assign those 999 year leases to third parties for consideration other than rent to raise finance. 
 The LTT implications are: 
 
 In these circumstances, the provisions of section 22 LTTA (deemed market value rules where a buyer is a company connected to the seller) would deem the chargeable consideration for the sale transaction to be market value, irrespective of the value of the exchange element. 
 The leaseback transaction is an exchange, so the chargeable consideration for the leaseback transaction will be the market value of the interest acquired. 
 Any subsequent assignment of the leases by Ms F would be chargeable transactions, based on the consideration other than rent given for the assignment. 
 
 In this example all conditions of the sale and leaseback relief are met and therefore the leaseback transaction is relieved. 
 The sale transaction (transfer by Ms F to G Ltd) is treated as the acquisition of the encumbered freehold by G Ltd. The market value of the encumbered freehold is likely to be negligible (999 year lease granted out of it for no premium and peppercorn rent) so an LTT charge would not arise.

529,529,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Sale and leaseback relief, ," H Ltd, the parent company of a group of companies, owns a freehold interest in a commercial property. To raise finance it decides to sell the property to an unconnected company Y Ltd in consideration of £2m and a leaseback at market rent of the whole of the property. 
 H Ltd, following the sale transaction, wants 1 of its subsidiary companies, I Ltd, to own the lease and asks Y Ltd to grant the lease to I Ltd. 
 Whilst H Ltd and I Ltd are members of the same group, they are separate persons in law, and as such the conditions for the sale and leaseback relief are not met because the lease (the leaseback transaction) is granted to a company (I Ltd) that was not the seller (H Ltd) in relation to the sale transaction. 
 Therefore, both the sale transaction and the leaseback transaction will be chargeable to LTT with consideration for each transaction based on the market value of each interest acquired.

 Ms J lives in Apartment 1 with her boyfriend, Mr K. Apartment 2 is vacant. 
 Ms J plans to transfer the freehold of the whole property to a company that she has created, of which she will be the Sole Director. 
 A leasehold for Apartment 1 will then be granted to Ms J and Mr K, who will hold equal shares in the property. They will re-mortgage the property and continue to live in it. 
 A leasehold for Apartment 2 will be granted to Ms J, who will re-mortgage it under a buy-to-let mortgage. The proceeds of the re-mortgage will be used to redeem the existing freehold mortgage, leaving the freehold unmortgaged. 
 The leaseback of Apartment 2 (from the company to Ms J) will qualify for sale and leaseback relief (if it meets the conditions outlined above). 
 However, the lease of Apartment 1 (from the company to Ms J and Mr K) will not qualify for the relief as the seller of the freehold and the lessee are not the same.

 They then plan to lease the property back to Mr L, Mr M and Mr N, but not to Mr O. 
 This lease transaction will not qualify for sale and leaseback relief. This is because the seller of the freehold (‘A’), as discussed in the guidance above, comprises 4 people, but the lease is only granted to 3 people. The lessees are not therefore the same as ‘A’.

533,533,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Reconstruction and acquisition reliefs,LTTA/7071 Reconstruction relief," (Paragraph 2 of Schedule 17) 
 This relief allows land and buildings to be transferred between 2 companies as part of a transfer of an undertaking in exchange for shares, where there is no change of ownership, without any charge to LTT. 
 An example of a reconstruction of companies is where a company decides to split an existing business, which is carried on by one company, into 2 which is then carried on by 2 companies. 
 Relief must be withdrawn, and the land transaction assessed to the appropriate rates of LTT, if certain events occur. 
 On acquiring all or part of the undertaking that is, part of the business, of another company (the target company), in pursuance of a scheme for the reconstruction of the target company, the acquiring company, that is, the company acquiring the target company, may enter into a land transaction as part of, or in connection with, that scheme. 
 Where the 2 conditions are met, relief from LTT is available. 
 First condition 
 
 the consideration for the acquisition consists wholly or partly of the issue of non-redeemable shares in the acquiring company, and 
 the shares must be issued to all the shareholders of the target company. 
 
 Where the consideration consists partly of the issue of non-redeemable shares, this condition is only fulfilled if all of the balance of the consideration consists solely of the assumption or discharge, by the acquiring company, of liabilities of the target company (such as the acquiring company assuming the debts of the target company). 
 Second condition 
 After the acquisition has been made: 
 
 the shareholders of the acquiring company are all shareholders of the target company and the shareholders of the target company are all shareholders of the acquiring company 
 for each shareholder, the proportion of shares held in one company is the same (or as nearly as may be the same) as the proportion of shares held in the other company. 
 
 The only time the proportions do not have to match exactly is when there are insufficient shares of one company to allow the shareholders to match their proportions of shares in the other company. In this case, any reasonable disposition of the shares to allow matching as nearly as possible is acceptable (but so that control of one company is the same as control of the other company). 
 Such a situation may arise where the target company has more shares issued than the acquiring company. For example if the acquiring company has 100 shares whereas the target company has 1000 shares (with 3 shareholders one holding 334 and 2 holding 333 shares each), then the shareholding in the acquiring company being 34, 33 and 33 would be as nearly as possible to the shareholding in the target company, even though the shareholder with 34 shares has an increased interest in the acquiring company compared to their interest in the target company. 
 The reference to shareholders means that the relief is not available unless the target company has a share capital. It follows therefore that the relief is not available, for example, where the target or acquiring company is a company limited by guarantee, not having a share capital, or an unincorporated association. 
 Any shares that the target or acquiring company owns in itself, such as treasury shares acquired as a result of a share buyback, are to be treated as cancelled for the purposes of this relief. The company is therefore not treated as owning any shares in itself. 
 It should be noted that the relief is subject to the relief anti-avoidance rule.

534,534,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Reconstruction and acquisition reliefs,LTTA/7072 Acquisition relief," (Paragraph 3 of Schedule 17) 
 On purchasing all or part of the undertaking of another company (the target company) the acquiring company (the company acquiring the target company) may enter into a land transaction as part of, or in connection with, the transfer of the purchased undertaking. 
 It applies where a property is transferred as part of the acquisition of an undertaking of another company in exchange for shares and no more than 10% cash. 
 Where the 3 conditions are met, LTT is chargeable in connection with the land transaction, entered into at a rate of 0.5%. 
 Relief must be withdrawn, and the land transaction assessed to the appropriate rates of LTT, if certain events occur. 
 First condition 
 The consideration for the acquisition consists wholly or partly of the issue of non-redeemable shares in the acquiring company. These shares must be issued to: 
 
 the target company, or 
 any or all of the shareholders of the target company. 
 
 Where the consideration consists partly of the issue of non-redeemable shares, this condition is only fulfilled if all the balance of the consideration consists of: 
 
 cash which does not exceed 10% of the nominal value of the non-redeemable shares issued for the transaction 
 the assumption or discharge, by the acquiring company, of liabilities of the target company, or  
 both of these things. 
 
 Second condition 
 The acquiring company must not be associated with any other company that is a party to arrangements with the target company relating to the shares issued to the target company as a result of the transfer of the undertaking. 
 Third condition 
 The undertaking or part of the undertaking of the target company that is acquired must not have as its main activity a trade that is wholly or mainly the dealing in chargeable interests. 
 The reference to shareholders means that the relief is not available unless the target company has a share capital. It follows therefore that the relief is not available, for example, where the target or acquiring company is a company limited by guarantee, not having a share capital, or an unincorporated association. 
 It should be noted that the relief is subject to the relief anti-avoidance rule.

 Where reconstruction or acquisition relief has been claimed on a land transaction relief is withdrawn if control of the acquiring company changes: 
 
 before the end of a period of three years beginning with the effective date of the relieved transaction, or 
 in pursuance of, or in connection with, arrangements made before the end of a period of 3 years, beginning with the effective date of the relieved transaction 
 
 and, at the time that control of the acquiring company changes it, or a relevant associated company, holds a chargeable interest: 
 
 that was acquired by the acquiring company under the relevant transaction, or  
 that is derived from the chargeable interest acquired by the acquiring company under the relevant transaction (for example if a headlease was acquired under the relevant land transaction, the reversion of a sublease granted out of that headlease would be a chargeable interest derived from the original chargeable interest), and 
 that chargeable interest has not subsequently been transferred at market value by means of a chargeable transaction where reconstruction or acquisition relief was available but not claimed. 
 
 Control of a company changes when the company becomes controlled by: 
 
 a different person 
 a different number of persons 
 2 or more persons at least one of whom is not the person, or one of the persons, by whom the company was previously controlled. 
 
 Reconstruction and acquisition relief is withdrawn: 
 
 if control of the acquiring company changes within 3 years of the transaction 
 if there are arrangements put in place within that period which result in a change of control after the period of 3 years.

 Reconstruction or acquisition relief is not withdrawn where control of the acquiring company changes as a result of: 
 
 a share transaction effected in accordance with the rules relating to transactions in connection with divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership 
 a share transaction effected in accordance with the rules related to the variation of testamentary dispositions etc. 
 an exempt intra-group transfer. An ‘exempt intra-group’ transfer is a transfer of shares effected by an instrument which is exempt from stamp duty by virtue of section 42 Finance Act 1930 or Section 11 of the Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 transfers of shares between associated companies. However, relief may be withdrawn following a subsequent non-exempt transfer 
 a transfer of shares to another company in relation to which share acquisition relief applies. ‘Share acquisition relief’ is provided by section 77 Finance Act 1986.  However, relief may be withdrawn following a subsequent non-exempt transfer 
 a loan creditor becoming, or ceasing to be, treated as having control of the company and the other persons treated as having control of the company before the loan creditor was so treated continue to, or would be, treated as having control. 
 
 As noted above 2 exceptions apply, meaning that relief is not withdrawn, but a subsequent non-exempt transfer occurs within the 3 year period, there are provisions which ensure that relief is then withdrawn at that time.

537,537,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Reconstruction and acquisition reliefs,LTTA/7075 Withdrawal of reconstruction or acquisition relief on subsequent non-exempt transfer," (Paragraph 7 Schedule 17) 
 There are 2 cases where a subsequent event can lead to the withdrawal in full or in part of the reconstruction or acquisition relief. 
 Case 1 – exempt intra-group transfer 
 Where relief has been claimed, and not withdrawn, on the basis that an exempt intra-group transfer has occurred but: 
 
 a company that holds shares in the acquiring company (or that are derived from shares to which the exempt intra-group transfer relates) subsequently ceases to be a member of the same group as the target company, and that event occurs before the end of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relieved transaction, or occurs after that date but is in connection with arrangements made within that 3 year period, and 
 the acquiring company, or a relevant associated company, holds a chargeable interest that was acquired by a relieved transaction, or, that is derived from such a chargeable interest, and that chargeable interest has not subsequently been transferred at market value by means of a chargeable transaction where reconstruction or acquisition relief was available but not claimed. 
 
 Case 2 – share acquisition relief applied 
 Where relief has been claimed, and not withdrawn, on the basis that there has been a change of control of the acquiring company as a result of a transfer to which share acquisition relief applies but: 
 
 control of the other company changes when that company holds shares transferred to it by the transfer to which share acquisition relief applied, or any shares derived from the shares transferred and, before the end of 3 years beginning with the effective date of the relieved transaction, or occurs after that date but is in connection with arrangements made within that 3 year period, and 
 the acquiring company, or a relevant associated company, holds a chargeable interest that was acquired by a relieved transaction, or, that is derived from such a chargeable interest, and that chargeable interest has not subsequently been transferred at market value by means of a chargeable transaction where reconstruction or acquisition relief was available but not claimed.  
 
 The effect is to withdraw relief when the chargeable interest originally with the target company could (but does not have to) come under control of someone outside the group as a result of a company originally in the group (and which holds shares in the acquiring company) leaving the group.

538,538,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Reconstruction and acquisition reliefs,LTTA/7076 Withdrawal of reconstruction or acquisition relief on subsequent non-exempt transfer," (Paragraph 7 Schedule 17) 
 Reconstruction or acquisition relief in relation to the relevant land transaction (or an appropriate proportion of it) is withdrawn and LTT becomes chargeable. 
 Where it is necessary to withdraw reconstruction or acquisition relief, the amount of relief withdrawn depends on: 
 
 the chargeable interest obtained by the buyer on the effective date of the original land transaction 
 the chargeable interest held by the buyer (and any relevant associated company) at the time of the event causing withdrawal of relief. 
 
 The effect of the withdrawal of relief is to tax the chargeable interest remaining with the buyer (and any relevant associated company) as if no claim to reconstruction or acquisition relief had been made. 
 The LTT payable is that which would have been payable in respect of the original land transaction for which reconstruction or acquisition relief was claimed. 
 The chargeable consideration for the transaction is calculated as the market value of the chargeable interest transferred by the original land transaction. 
 This is modified where the chargeable interest held by the purchaser (and any relevant associated company) at the time reconstruction or acquisition relief is withdrawn is not the same as the chargeable interest transferred by the original land transaction. 
 In this case, the LTT payable is that which would have been payable in respect of an appropriate proportion of the original land transaction for which relief was claimed. 
 The appropriate proportion is the fraction of the market values of the chargeable interests held by the acquiring company (as buyer) and any relevant associated companies at the time of withdrawal of reconstruction or acquisition relief, calculated by reference to the effective date of the relevant land transaction, and in relation to the market value of the chargeable interests obtained by the acquiring company (as buyer) at the effective date of the relevant land transaction.

 Once the LTT payable as a result of a withdrawal of reconstruction or acquisition relief has been determined (whether by passage of time or closure of an enquiry or otherwise), liability to pay the tax is the responsibility of the acquiring company. 
 Where such tax (or any part of it) has not been paid within a period of 6 months of the date on which it became payable, recovery of the unpaid amount is possible from other persons. 
 The persons from whom the LTT may be recovered are: 
 
 a company which at any relevant time was a member of the same group as the acquiring company and was above it in the group structure. For these purposes:
	 
 any relevant time means any time between the effective date of the relevant transaction and the date of change of control by virtue of which tax is chargeable, and

 Meaning of an undertaking 
 The term ‘undertaking’ refers to the business, trade or enterprise of the target company which is transferred to (and is then carried on substantially unchanged by) the acquiring company. For there to be an undertaking it is implicit that some business must be carried on. 
 Business 
 The WRA considers that a ‘business’ includes ‘every trade, occupation or employment’, so ‘business’ is a very wide term embracing almost every common activity and is much wider than ‘trade’ or ‘profession’ alone. 
 The carrying on of a business ‘usually calls for some activity on the part of whoever carries it on’ (Lord Diplock in American Leaf Blending Co. v Director General, Privy Council 1978). 
 It can include a business of making investments where these investments are ‘actively managed’. As the Special Commissioner said in Martin & Another v CIR (SPC5/1995): ‘The mere receipt of rents from let property owned by an individual ‘raises no presumption that he is carrying on a business’ [per Lord Diplock in American Leaf], but where it can be shown that there is a continuing activity on what seems... to have been sound business principles …’it is likely that'…mere ownership or mere investment…’ may have become a business. 
 Part of undertaking 
 Whether the assets transferred comprise part of the undertaking of the target company, is largely a question of fact. If what is transferred is capable of existing on its own as a viable ‘business’ then it might comprise part of an undertaking, however, the mere partition of assets or investments is unlikely to be sufficient.

548,548,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Miscellaneous reliefs,LTTA/7107 Relief for acquisitions in consequence of reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies," (paragraph 9 of Schedule 22) 
 Relief may be claimed by a new local constituency association where a land transaction is entered into as a consequence of an Order in Council made under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (orders specifying new parliamentary constituencies) and the chargeable interest is transferred to it by a former local constituency association. In the absence of such an order no relief is available. 
 The relief allows for parliamentary constituencies to change and, as a consequence of that change, the previous local constituency association to transfer a chargeable interest to a new local constituency association without a charge to LTT arising. 
 A charge might otherwise arise when, for example, an old constituency is split into 2 and 2 new associations are formed, or where 2 previous constituencies merge and one is formed. 
 Any chargeable interest transferred to either of the new associations is eligible for relief. The relief also allows for those occasions where the chargeable interest is temporarily transferred to a related body before eventual transfer to the new association.

 ‘local constituency association’ means an unincorporated association whose primary purpose is to further the aims of a political party in an area that is or was the same or substantially the same as one or more parliamentary constituencies 
 ‘new association’ means a local constituency association whose area, at the relevant date, is the same (or substantially the same) as that of a new parliamentary constituency or 2 or more such constituencies 
 ‘new parliamentary constituency’ means an area that, for the purposes of parliamentary elections, is a constituency after the date of the relevant date but was not a constituency before that date

 An Order in Council provides for 2 constituencies to be merged into a single new constituency. Each existing local constituency association holds an interest in land. 
 Constituency association 1 (‘CA1’) owns a building outright, constituency association 2 (‘CA2’) owns a building subject to a mortgage of £200,000. 
 The following tax positions arise on the following facts: 
 
 the new association (CA3) is to use CA1’s property and CA2’s property is to be sold. If CA1’s property is transferred for no consideration, the transaction will be exempt. A third party acquiring CA2’s building will not be able to claim relief for acquisitions in consequence of reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies 
 the new association (CA3) is to use CA2’s property and CA1’s property is to be sold. If CA2’s property is transferred for no consideration other than the assumption of the debt, the chargeable consideration will be the amount of that debt. A third party acquiring CA1’s building will not be able to claim relief for acquisitions in consequence of reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies 
 the new association (CA3) is to use CA2’s property and CA1’s property is to be sold. The new association is not ready to receive the property on the date that the old association is dissolved. The property is therefore transferred to the central party property holding company. The intention is to transfer the property to the new association as soon as possible. The second transfer takes place 3 months later once the new association has been fully established and all relevant officers are in post. Both the transfer from CA2 to the central party’s property holding company and the transfer from that company to the new association are eligible for relief. A third party acquiring CA1’s building will not be able to claim relief for acquisitions in consequence of reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies

 However, in relation to a transaction effected under section 110 of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, a transfer of engagements from one registered credit union to another, may claim relief so long as it complies with the rules in section 21 of the Credit Unions Act 1979.

554,554,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7023 Alternative finance investment bonds relief," (Schedule 11) 
 This relief is provided to ensure that land transactions that occur as a result of bonds being issued which are alternative finance investment bonds, do not incur LTT charges where bonds issued under typical interest-bearing bonds would not. 
 Bonds are issued as a way of financing a business. Frequently the bonds pay an income stream to the bond-holders. Bonds that do not pay interest are possible. These are known as alternative finance investment bonds. A bond issuer will arrange the issue of the bonds to bond-holders for the person seeking finance. In typical interest-bearing bonds there is no need for the bond-issuer to take control of any assets, although a charge may be taken over all or some of the assets of a company. 
 When a taxpayer wishes to issue bonds through an alternative finance investment bond so that interest is not paid to the bond-holders but a income from rents or other profits, the arrangements will be structured in a way that will require the bond-issuer to take control of an asset, for the purposes of LTT of land or buildings, in order to generate an income stream for the bond-holders, commonly rents. 
 There is therefore a need for the person seeking finance to transfer the asset, for LTT purposes land and buildings, to the bond-issuer. The bond-issuer will then grant a lease to the person seeking the finance. The first transfer or sale provides the person seeking finance with that finance, and the grant of the lease to the person seeking finance generates the income stream which will be passed onto the bond-holders. The bond-holders will have provided the bond-issuer with the assets to pay the funds to the person seeking finance (or compensate them for that transfer). 
 At the end of the term of the bonds (which can last for no longer than 10 years) the land and buildings transferred to the bond-issuer will be transferred back to the person who sought the finance. 
 As can be seen there are 3 land transactions: 
 
 the property being transferred by the person seeking finance (the ‘seller’, and, the ‘original owner’) to a bond-issuer (‘the first transaction’ for alternative finance investment bonds relief) 
 the lease granted by the bond-issuer to the person seeking finance out of the interest that has been transferred to it (on which sale and leaseback relief for the leaseback leg can be claimed, and 
 on termination of the bond, the ownership of the property is transferred from the bond-issuer to the person seeking the finance  (‘the second transaction’ for alternative finance investment bonds relief).

 ‘Alternative finance investment bond’ means arrangements to which section 564G of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply. 
 ‘Arrangements’ includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions, or any of those things, whether or not legally enforceable. 
 ‘Bond assets’, ‘bond-holder’, ‘bond-issuer’ and ‘capital have the meaning given in section 564G of the Income Tax Act 2007. 
 ‘Qualifying interest’ means a major interest in land other than a lease for a term of 21 years or less.

556,556,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7025 Bond-holder is not treated as having an interest in the bond assets," (paragraph 3 of Schedule 11) 
 The bond-holder of an alternative finance investment bonds is not treated as having an interest in the bond assets; similarly, the bond-issuer under such a bond is not treated as a trustee of the bond assets.

557,557,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7026 Bond-holder treated as having an interest if control of the underlying asset acquired," (paragraph 4 of Schedule 11) 
 A bond holder under an alternative finance investment bond is treated as having an interest in the bond assets if control of the underlying asset is acquired by either the bond-holder or a group of connected bond-holders. 
 A bond-holder or group of connected bond-holders acquires control of the underlying asset if: 
 
 the rights of the bond-holder under an alternative finance investment bond includes the right of management and control of the assets, and 
 the bond-holder, or the group, acquires sufficient rights to enable them, or members of the group acting jointly, to exercise the right of management and control of the bond assets to the exclusion of any other bond-holder. 
 
 However, there are 2 cases where a bond-holder or group of bond-holders obtaining control of the underlying asset are not treated as having an interest in the underlying asset acquired. 
 The first case is where: 
 
 at the time the bond-holder, or a group of connected bond-holders, acquired the rights they did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that they were in a position to exercise management and control over the bond assets, and 
 as soon as practicably possible after they became aware of their ability to exercise control the bond-holder, or group of connected bondholders, transfer sufficient rights (the bonds) so that they no longer are able to exercise control. 
 
 The second case is where the bond-holder: 
 
 underwrites a public offer of rights under the bond, and 
 does not exercise the right of management and control of the bond assets. 
 
 The second case ensures that the bond-holder is not treated as having an interest in the underlying asset acquired where the person underwriting the issue of the bonds is required to acquire sufficient numbers of bonds, due to the issue not being sufficiently subscribed, that they are in a position to exercise control, but does not so exercise that control.

558,558,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7027 Conditions for the operation of the reliefs," (paragraphs 5-12 of Schedule 11)  
 There are 7 conditions that apply to the relief: 
 
 Condition 1 
	That the person seeking finance (‘A’) and the bond-issuer (‘B’) enter into arrangements where A transfers to B a qualifying interest in land (the ‘first transaction’) and both agree that B will transfer the interest to A when the interest ceases to be held as a bond asset. 
 Condition 2 
	That the bond-issuer enters into an alternative finance investment bond either before or after entering into the first transaction and the interest in land is held by the bond-issuer as a bond asset. 
 Condition 3 
	That in order to generate income or gains for the alternative finance investment bond, the bond-issuer and the person seeking finance enter into a leaseback agreement. The leaseback agreement is entered into if the bond-issuer grants a lease or sub-lease of the land to the person seeking finance. 
 Condition 4 
	That before the end of 120 days beginning with the effective date of the first transaction, the bond-issuer provides the WRA with prescribed evidence that a satisfactory legal charge has been entered on the title kept by the Chief Registrar. 
	The ‘prescribed evidence’ is set out in The Land Transaction Tax (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018. The evidence is:
	 
 any document provided by the Chief Land Registrar confirming that a legal charge has been entered in the register of title in favour of the WRA, and 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the original owner to the bond-issuer. 
 
 
 Condition 5 
	That before the termination of the bond, the total capital payments made to the bond-issuer is not less than 60% of the value of the interest in the land at the effective date of the first transaction. 
 Condition 6 
	That the bond-issuer holds the interest in land as a bond asset until the termination of the bond. 
 Condition 7 
	That once the interest in land ceases to be held by the bond-issuer as a bond asset, the interest is transferred to the original owner within 30 days (the ‘second transaction’). The second transaction must also be effected within 10 years of the first transaction.

 The relief is withdrawn if: 
 
 the interest held by the bond-issuer is transferred to the original owner without conditions 5 and 6 being met 
 the second transaction has not occurred within 10 years of the first transaction 
 it becomes apparent that for any reason conditions 5 to 7 cannot or will not be met, or 
 the charge has not been registered in favour of the WRA as set out in condition 4. 
 
 Where the relief is withdrawn, the amount of tax chargeable is based on the market value of the first transaction but without the claim to relief.

 The relief can be claimed for the second transaction if all 7 conditions are met and the taxpayer has complied with the provisions of the LTTA and TCMA in relation to the first transaction. That is, that the first transaction was the subject of a claim to relief and that a LTT return was made claiming that relief. 
 If the bond asset is replaced by another interest in land then this rule applies.

 If after the effective date of the second transaction the bond-issuer provides the WRA with the appropriate evidence that conditions 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 have been met, the land will cease to be subject to the charge registered by the Chief Land Registrar. 
 Where the charge is discharged, the WRA must notify the Chief Land Registrar of the discharge in accordance with their rules within 30 days of the bond-issuer providing the appropriate evidence to the WRA. 
 The ‘prescribed evidence’ is set out in The Land Transaction Tax (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018. The evidence is:   
 
 a statement from the bond-issuer, or a person authorised to act on behalf of the bond-issuer, that all of conditions 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 have been met 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the original owner to the bond-issuer

563,563,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7032 Relief not available where the bond-holder acquires control of the underlying asset," (paragraph 17 of Schedule 11) 
 Relief for the first or second transaction is not available if the bond-holder, or a group of connected bond-holders, acquire control of the underlying asset (the bond asset). 
 A bond-holder or group of connected bond-holders acquires control of the underlying asset if: 
 
 the rights of the bond-holder under an alternative finance investment bond include the right of management and control of the assets, and 
 the bond-holder, or the group, acquires sufficient rights to enable them, or members of the group acting jointly, to exercise the right of management and control of the bond assets to the exclusion of any other bond-holders. 
 
 Relief in relation to the first transaction is not available if the bond-holder, or the group of connected bond-holders, acquires control of the underlying asset within 30 days of the effective date of the first transaction. In such a case if the return has not yet been made, the relief must not be claimed. In the event that the return has been made the taxpayer (the bond-issuer) may make an amendment to the return if made before the filing date for the return, or must make a further return within 30 days of the event that led to the relief being withdrawn. 
 Relief in relation to the first transaction is also withdrawn if the bond-holder or the group acquires control of the underlying asset at any time after the 30 day period following the effective date and conditions 1 to 3 have been met. In this case the taxpayer (the bond-issuer) must make a further return within 30 days of the event that led to the relief being withdrawn. 
 However, if control of the underlying asset is acquired by either the bond-holder, or a group of connected bold-holders, but either of 2 cases apply, the relief for the first or second transaction is still available and not withdrawn. 
 The first case is where: 
 
 at the time the bond-holder, or a group of connected bond-holders, acquired the rights, they did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that they were in a position to exercise management and control over the bond assets, and 
 as soon as practicably possible after they became aware of their ability to exercise control the bond-holder, or group of connected bondholders, transfer sufficient rights (the bonds) so that they no longer are able to exercise control. 
 
 The second case is where the bond-holder: 
 
 underwrites a public offer of rights under the bond, and  
 does not exercise the right of management and control of the bond assets. 
 
 The second case ensures that the relief is not denied where the person underwriting the issue of the bonds is required to acquire sufficient numbers of bonds, due to the issue not being sufficiently subscribed, that they are in a position to exercise control, but does not so exercise that control.

564,564,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Reliefs / Alternative finance investment bonds relief,LTTA/7033 Replacement of a bond asset for another asset," (paragraph 18 of Schedule 11) 
 It is possible for the bond-holder to substitute one bond asset for another and for relief to still be claimable and not be withdrawn. The reason why land might need to be substituted is that a person seeking finance and having committed one property to be the underlying asset in an alternative finance investment bond, may at some point during the course of the period that the bond arrangements are in place, need the property for another purpose, including so that it can be sold. 
 Certain conditions must be met in relation to the land first used as the bond asset (the ‘original land’) and the land that is substituted for the original land (the ‘replacement land’). 
 Relief continues to be available in relation to the original land, and becomes available for the replacement land, if: 
 
 conditions 1 to 3 and 7 are met in relation to the original land 
 the bond-issuer ceases to hold the original land as a bond asset (and transfers it to the original owner) before the termination of the alternative finance investment bond 
 the original owner and the bond-issuer enter into further arrangements falling within condition 1 relating to an interest in the replacement land, and 
 the value of the interest in the replacement land at the time that it is transferred from the original owner to the bond-issuer is greater than or equal to the value of the interest in the original land at the time of the first transaction. 
 
 Where there is a substitution of land in an alternative finance investment bond it does not matter that condition 6 in relation to the original land will not be met (that the land is a bond asset until the termination of the bond) if conditions 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are met in relation to the replacement land. 
 In relation to the replacement land: 
 
 condition 5 applies as if the reference to the interest in the land were a reference to the interest in the original land, and 
 condition 7 applies as if the reference to the first transaction were a reference to the first transaction relating to the original land. 
 
 If the replacement land is in Wales, the original land ceases to be subject to the charge registered in pursuance of condition 4 when: 
 
 the bond-issuer provides the WRA with the evidence that condition 7 is met in relation to the original land, and 
 condition 4 is met in relation to the replacement land. 
 
 Where charge is discharged, the WRA must notify the Chief Land Registrar of the discharge of security within 30 days of the bond-issuer providing the appropriate evidence. 
 The ‘prescribed evidence’ is set out in The Land Transaction Tax (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018. The evidence is: 
 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the original owner to the bond-issuer 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the bond-issuer to the original owner, and 
 any document as provided by the Chief Land Registrar confirming that the original land has been registered in the name of the original owner. 
 
 If the replacement land is not in Wales, the original land ceases to be subject to the charge registered with the Chief Land Registrar in pursuance of condition 4 when the bond-issuer provides the WRA with the prescribed evidence that: 
 
 condition 7 is met in relation to the original land, and 
 each of conditions 1 to 3 is met in relation to the replacement land. 
 
 Where charge is discharged, the WRA must notify the Chief Land Registrar of the discharge of security within 30 days of the bond-issuer providing the appropriate evidence. 
 The ‘prescribed evidence’ is set out in The Land Transaction Tax (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018. The evidence is: 
 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the original owner to the bond-issuer 
 the UTRN for the return on which relief from tax was claimed in relation to the transaction where land was transferred from the bond-issuer to the original owner 
 any document that proves that the replacement land is not in Wales and that conditions 1 to 3 in Part 3 of the Schedule have been met in relation to that land, and 
 any document as provided by the Chief Land Registrar confirming that the original land has been registered in the name of the original owner.  
 
 All of the rules above apply to further replacement land as they apply to replacement land.

565,565,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Taxpayer information,TCMA/7010 Use of taxpayer information," The WRA will protect and handle taxpayer information with care. WRA may only use information it has acquired in connection with its functions (subject to any international obligations of the UK that restricts or prohibits the use of information). 
 Protected taxpayer information (‘PTI’) is information the WRA has (or any person to which the WRA has delegated its functions), which could lead to that person being identified. Information is not ‘PTI’ if it is information about internal administrative arrangements of the WRA or in relation to a member of WRA staff.

566,566,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Taxpayer information,TCMA/7020 Confidentiality of PTI," There is a statutory obligation for ‘relevant officials’ to treat PTI confidentially. Relevant officials are: 
 
 an individual who is (or was) a member of WRA staff, or a member of a WRA committee or sub-committee 
 an individual who is (or was) exercising functions or providing services on behalf of WRA. This would also include anyone who provides services to any individual to which WRA has delegated functions. 
 
 The general rule is that PTI must not be disclosed. 
 A relevant official may, however, disclose PTI where specifically permitted by law to do so.

567,567,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Taxpayer information,TCMA/7030 Permitted disclosures of PTI," WRA will use, share or disclose PTI in clearly defined circumstances where it is legally required or permitted to do so, and where the WRA considers that it is proportionate and in the public interest to do so. 
 It is permitted: 
 
 with the consent of each person to whom the information relates 
 for the purposes of obtaining services in connection with a function of WRA. This includes contracts and shared service agreements entered into between WRA and other public sector bodies or private sector providers 
 for the purposes of criminal investigations or criminal proceedings or for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime 
 if it is made to a relevant regulatory body 
 for the purposes of civil proceedings 
 if the information is needed in relation to a court order or tribunal proceedings 
 to a person exercising functions on behalf of the WRA for the purposes of those functions, such as a contractor.

568,568,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Taxpayer information,TCMA/7040 Declaration of confidentiality," Relevant officials who have access to protected taxpayer information must make a formal declaration acknowledging their obligation of confidentiality. This must happen as soon as possible after their appointment. The format of the declaration will be determined by WRA.

569,569,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Taxpayer information,TCMA/7050 Consequences of wrongful disclosure of PTI," A relevant official commits a criminal offence if they unlawfully disclose PTI. 
 Someone charged with wrongfully disclosing PTI could use the defence that they reasonably believed the disclosure was lawful. Alternatively, they could claim that the information disclosed had already been lawfully made public. However, the person charged with the offence has the responsibility for proving this.

 The Data Protection Act 1998 (for example data protection principle 7 in schedule 1 of the Act, that appropriate technical and organisational measures must be taken to protect all personal data) 
 The Human Rights Act 1998, and 
 The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

571,571,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6010 Introduction," Most people will pay the WRA any money due (whether on tax, penalties or interest) on time. Some people, however, are either not able to pay the sum of money on time or will choose not to pay it upon demand. 
 It is important that the taxpayer makes the WRA aware as soon as possible about any difficulties they may have, or expect to have, in paying any money they owe. Where appropriate, and considering each case on an individual basis, the WRA will then seek to work together with the taxpayer to find a payment arrangement which is acceptable both to both parties. 
 There will however be cases where, given the circumstances, the WRA does not consider it possible or appropriate to enter into such arrangements. In such cases, and where the taxpayer has failed to respond to a demand for payment, the WRA may undertake enforcement action to recover the debt. 
 If a person owes us money but we do not have their contact details, in certain circumstances we can give a notice requiring a third party to provide us with those contact details. 
 This guidance only covers civil debt recovery and does not deal with recovery measures following criminal proceedings, such as those provided for under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-debt-recovery-technical-guidance
572,572,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6020 Contract settlements," If the taxpayer has, or expects to have, difficulties in paying any money owed (such as following the end of an enquiry or investigation), where appropriate (and considering each case on an individual basis) the WRA will seek to work together with the taxpayer to find a payment arrangement which is acceptable to both parties. This is in line with the WRA’s commitment to treat all taxpayers fairly and collect the devolved taxes properly and efficiently.  
 One option is a contract settlement. A contract settlement is a legally binding agreement between the taxpayer and the WRA over the taxpayer’s liability to pay a sum of money to the WRA in relation to the devolved taxes. It is not to be confused with a settlement agreement which is a specific agreement reached between the taxpayer and the WRA in relation to a dispute. 
 The WRA has a degree of discretion in arranging the form a specific contract agreement takes, but this is dependent on the specific circumstances of the case.

573,573,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6030 Debt recovery," If the WRA issues a demand to pay a sum of money owed (whether tax, penalties, interest or a combination of any of these) and, following the demand, the taxpayer has still not paid that sum, the WRA may undertake enforcement action to recover the debt. 
 The WRA has a range of powers to secure recovery of debt. These include: 
 
 In cases where an outstanding amount (up to £2000) of tax, penalties or interest has not been paid, the WRA may initiate civil proceedings in magistrates’ court to recover the debt. These proceedings must normally be instigated within 12 months of the day following the date on which the tax, penalty or interest should have been paid. 
 Enforcement by taking control of goods, using the procedure in Schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c. 15) (taking control of goods). 
 Initiating civil or criminal proceedings, including County Court and High Court.

574,574,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6040 Certification of debt," The WRA may issue a certificate of debt if a taxpayer has failed to pay tax, penalties or interest. A certificate by the WRA (or any document purporting to be such a certificate) is sufficient evidence of that fact until the contrary is proved. The purpose of such a certificate is to provide evidence to the court in support of any debt or action which we administer, avoiding the need for lengthy documentation.

575,575,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6050 Debtor contact notice," In certain circumstances, the WRA has the power to give a notice to a third party requiring them to provide the WRA with the contact details of a person who owes money to the WRA (section 93 TCMA). 
 ‘Contact details’ means the debtor’s address and any other information about how the debtor can be contacted. 
 This is not a power which is used to simply find out more about a taxpayer. Other powers are available to the WRA for carrying out more detailed investigations on a person’s tax position, such as powers of enquiry, information notices, and inspection. 
 The WRA may only issue a debtor contact notice where: 
 
 the WRA reasonably requires the contact details in order to collect the sum of money owed 
 the WRA has reasonable grounds for believing that the third party has the required contact details, and 
 
 either: 
 
 the third party is a company or unincorporated association, or 
 the WRA has reasonable grounds to believe that the third party obtained the details in the course of carrying on a business. 
 
 ‘Carrying on a business’ includes: 
 
 carrying on any activity for the purposes of generating income from land (wherever situated) 
 carrying on a profession 
 the activities of a charity, and 
 the activities of a local authority or any other public authority. 
 
 The WRA cannot issue a debtor contact notice to a third party which: 
 
 is a charity and obtained the contact details in the course of providing services free of charge, or 
 is not a charity but obtained the contact details in the course of providing services on behalf of a charity that are free of charge to the recipient of the service. 
 
 Complying with the notice 
 The notice issued by the WRA to the third party must name the debtor and specify or describe the period, means and form in which the contact details must be provided. A third party who fails to comply with the notice in any respect is liable to a penalty. A third party can seek a review or appeal against the giving of such a notice (or any requirement in it) only in specific circumstances.

576,576,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Interest,TCMA/4010 Late payment interest," The WRA will charge interest on any amount of unpaid tax, commencing from the late payment interest start date and ending on the date it is paid.  
 The late payment interest start date for particular amounts of tax is stated in the following table: 
 
 
 
 Amount of tax unpaid 
 Late payment interest start date 
 
 
 
 
 Amount stated in a tax return 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a return amended by the taxpayer (s41 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA correction notice (s42 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in an amendment to a return made by the WRA (s45 or s50 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA assessment (s54 or s55 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA determination (s52 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date when the return was required to be made 
			  
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA assessment where no tax return (s54 or s55 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date when the return was required to be made 
			  
 
 
 
 The late payment interest start date may be a non-business day. The date of payment includes the date on which the amount is set off against another amount payable by the WRA. 
 The interest charged is simple interest, not compound interest. This means that late payment interest is only calculated on the amount of unpaid tax and not on late payment interest that has already been charged or accrued. The Tax Collection and Management (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018 set out the late payment interest rates. The percentage per annum interest rate charged for late payment of tax is the Bank of England rate +2.5%. 
 When an amount is paid to the WRA, it must issue a receipt if requested. 
 If a taxpayer dies before an amount becomes due and payable, and the executor of the deceased taxpayer is unable to pay the amount before obtaining probate or letters of administration, the late payment interest start date is the later of: 
 
 the date the late payment interest would have started if the taxpayer had not died, and 
 the day after the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the grant of probate or letters of administration.

577,577,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Interest,TCMA/4020 Late payment interest on penalties," The WRA will charge interest on an amount of unpaid penalty from the date on which the penalty was due to be paid until is the day it is paid (this includes non-business days. See TCMA/3040 for more information on penalty due dates. 
 ‘Unpaid penalty’ means a penalty which has not been paid in full by the due date. 
 The percentage per annum interest rate charged for late payment of a penalty is the percentage per annum figure of the Bank of England rate + 2.5%. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-interest-technical-guidance
578,578,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Interest,TCMA/4030 Repayment interest," The WRA will pay interest on any repayment of: 
 
 tax 
 penalties, and 
 interest (which the taxpayer may have had to previously pay on the tax or penalties). 
 
 In all cases, any repayment must relate to amount of devolved taxes or penalties; the WRA will not repay any amounts that were paid to the WRA in error. 
 Repayment interest starts on: 
 
 the date that the payment was made by the taxpayer, or 
 the date on which the amount became payable to WRA 
 
 whichever is later. 
 The start date may be a non-business day. 
 Repayment interest ends on the date the repayment is made by the WRA. 
 The Tax Collection and Management (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018 set out the late repayment interest rates. The percentage interest rate applied is the higher of: 
 
 0.5% per annum, or 
 the Bank of England rate. 
 
 The interest paid is simple interest, not compound interest. This means that repayment interest is only calculated on the amount of tax, penalties or interest (on tax or penalties) which is being repaid, and not on repayment interest that has already been accrued.

579,579,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9010 Introduction," The WRA needs to be able to check that the correct amounts of tax have been paid at the right time in order to carry out its general function, which is the collection and management of the devolved taxes. To do this it may need to: 
 
 issue information notices, gather information and examine documents, or 
 inspect premises and any equipment and documents held on those premises 
 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
580,580,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9020 Overview of information notices," The WRA may use the following types of information notice to require a person to provide information or a document: 
 
 Taxpayer notices 
 Third party notices 
 Unidentified third party notices 
 Identification notices 
 
 The WRA may also issue debtor contact notices, which are subject to different requirements and procedures. 
 The WRA may issue an information notice where the information or document requested is required for the purposes of checking a person’s “tax position” and it is reasonable to require the person to provide the information or document. 
 The WRA may either specify or describe the information or documents being sought. This means that the WRA might require a specific document (e.g. a particular contract document), documents of a particular kind, or documents which contain a particular kind of information (e.g. any document containing information relating to a particular transaction, or to a particular time period). 
 The concept of a person’s “tax position” is wide and includes the person‘s past, present and future liability to pay any devolved tax or associated penalties, interest and any other related amounts that have been paid (or may be payable) by the person. It also includes related amounts that may be payable to the person by the WRA. 
 It follows therefore, that an information notice can be used in relation to an ongoing enquiry into a tax return or claim or to help the WRA in making a determination or an assessment. Checking a person’s potential future liability is likely to be a rare occurrence but it may be relevant, for example, in relation to certain types of land transaction which are staged over a long period and in relation to which a tax return might be made before all the liability to tax arises. 
 In some circumstances, an information notice may only be issued with the approval of the tribunal. 
 There are a number of restrictions preventing the WRA from providing certain information or certain documents in particular circumstances. 
 Where an information notice is issued, the recipient must comply with it.

581,581,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9030 Taxpayer notices," The WRA may issue a taxpayer notice requiring the recipient of the notice (the taxpayer) to provide information or produce a document to the WRA. A taxpayer notice must be approved by the tribunal. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
582,582,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9040 Third party notices," The WRA may issue a third party notice requiring the recipient to provide information or produce a document in relation to another person (the taxpayer). The WRA may not issue a third party notice without the approval of the tribunal or agreement of the taxpayer. 
 A third party notice must name the taxpayer and a copy of it must be issued to the taxpayer, although the tribunal may disapply one or both of these requirements if it is satisfied that the WRA has grounds for believing that naming the taxpayer or issuing the taxpayer with a copy of the notice might seriously prejudice the assessment or collection of the tax. 
 A number of additional requirements apply in relation to a third party notice issued in respect of a group of undertakings or a partnership. 
 Groups of undertakings 
 Where a third party notice is issued to a person for the purpose of checking the tax position of a parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries: 
 
 the notice must state its purpose (in addition to meeting the other requirements relating to third party notices), and 
 the parent undertaking is considered as the “taxpayer” (for the purposes of agreeing to the notice and being sent a copy of it) 
 
 Partnerships 
 Where a third party notice is issued, for the purposes of checking the tax position of a partnership, to someone who is not one of the partners: 
 
 the notice must state its purpose (in addition to meeting the other requirements relating to third party notices) and give the partnership’s registered name (or name by which it is known), and 
 A copy of the notice must be issued to at least one of the partners 
 
 The tribunal may disapply any of these requirements if it is satisfied that the WRA has grounds for believing that complying with them might seriously prejudice the assessment of collection of the tax.

583,583,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9050 Tribunal approval of taxpayer notices and third party notices," The WRA may not issue a taxpayer notice without the approval of the tribunal. The WRA may not issue a third party notice without the agreement of the taxpayer or the approval of the tribunal. The test that the tribunal must apply when deciding whether to approve a taxpayer notice or third party notice will depend on whether the recipient has been told that the WRA will be applying for approval. 
 If the recipient has not been told that the WRA will be applying for tribunal approval, the tribunal must be satisfied that the requirements for the issue of the notice have been met; and that giving notice of the application might prejudice the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 If the recipient has been told that the WRA will be applying for tribunal approval, the tribunal must be satisfied that: the requirements for the issue of the respective notice have been met; the recipient of the notice has been told about the information or documents required by the WRA; and the recipient has been given an opportunity to make representations about that request to the WRA. Where representations are made, the WRA must provide the tribunal with details of those representations. In the case of a third party notice, the tribunal must be satisfied that the taxpayer who is the subject of the notice, has been told by the WRA why the information or documents are required. 
 When a recipient has been told that the WRA is going to require the information or documents in a formal notice, it is a criminal offence under section 115 TCMA if a person conceals, destroys or otherwise disposes of the information or documents. 
 The tribunal may disapply some of the above requirements where giving notice of the application to the taxpayer or third party might prejudice the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 The tribunal may make such modifications of the notice as it thinks appropriate (for example the tribunal might think it is reasonable for the WRA to require some documents but not others and might restrict the scope of the information notice accordingly).

584,584,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9060 Unidentified third party notices," The WRA may, with the approval of the tribunal, issue an unidentified third party notice, requiring a person (the recipient) to provide information or produce a document relating to the tax position of a person whose identify it does not know or a class of persons whose individual identities it does not know. 
 In order to approve an unidentified third party notice, the tribunal must be satisfied that the WRA is not able to obtain the information or documents from another source. The tribunal must also be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person or persons who are the subject of the notice have failed (or may fail) to comply with the law related to a devolved tax and this has led (or will lead) to serious prejudice to the assessment or collection of devolved tax (for example, the WRA might have grounds to believe that the person involved in the land transaction is not going to come forward and make a tax return). The tribunal may make such modifications of the notice as it thinks appropriate.

585,585,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9070 Identification notices," The WRA may, with the tribunal’s approval, issue an identification notice to someone requiring them to provide limited information about a person (either a single person or class of persons), namely the person’s name, last known address and date of birth, in order to establish a taxpayer’s identity. The WRA can issue an identification notice where it has grounds for believing that the recipient will be able to ascertain the identity of the taxpayer (from information held by WRA) and that the recipient obtained relevant information about the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business. 
 While an identification notice is similar to an unidentified third party notice, the information that may be required is much more limited and the WRA does not have to prove that there are grounds to believe that the unidentified person may have failed to comply with the law relating to devolved tax. In practice this procedure is likely to be used where the WRA knows that something has happened which attracts a tax liability (e.g. a land transaction) and wishes to contact the persons involved but does not know their identity. They may seek to use this power prior to the point where any failure to comply with the law occurs so that they are able to contact the taxpayer to give him or her the opportunity to get their tax affairs in order.

586,586,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9080 Debtor contact notice," The WRA may issue a notice (debtor contact notice) requiring a person to provide contact details (a person’s address and any other contact information) for another person if it needs to contact a person who owes the WRA money but who the WRA has been unable to get hold of. This procedure can only be used if the contact details have been obtained by a person in the course of business, but cannot be used to ask for information from charities or persons providing services to charities free of charge.

587,587,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9090 Time limit for issuing a tribunal approved information notice," Where the tribunal approves an information notice, the WRA must issue it within 3 months of that approval, or a shorter period if specified by the tribunal. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
588,588,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9100 Complying with an information notice," The recipient of an information notice must comply with it and provide the required information or documents within a time period, location (which cannot be a place solely used as a dwelling) and in the manner specified in the information notice. The duty to comply with the information notice is suspended where the recipient has requested a review of the notice or made an appeal against it. A person who does not comply with an information notice may be liable to a penalty. 
 Where an information notice requires the person to produce a document, the person may comply by producing a copy of the original document (unless the notice specifically requests the original, or within 6 months of the copy being produced the WRA subsequently requests it). 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
589,589,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9110 General restrictions," An information notice may not require a person to produce a document if the whole of it originates more than 6 years before the date of the notice, unless the notice is issued with the approval of the tribunal. An information notice issued to check the tax position of someone who has died cannot be given more than 4 years after the death. A person is only required to produce a document if it is in their possession or power. 
 An information notice may not require a person to provide information or a document (part or full) where it relates to an ongoing review or appeal in relation to any tax (whether or not the tax is a “devolved tax”). For example, if HMRC is conducting an enquiry into a person’s self-assessment income tax return, the WRA cannot require information in relation to the same person’s devolved tax position if the information also relates to HMRC’s enquiry. 
 The WRA cannot require a person to provide material created, acquired or otherwise in someone’s possession for the purposes of journalism. Nor may WRA require a person to provide personal records or personal information contained in records, such as medical records. 
 The WRA may not issue a taxpayer notice in relation to a transaction or an accounting period (to check the tax position for those) where a person has made a tax return in relation to that transaction or accounting period. If the WRA wishes to check the tax position in relation to the tax return it should open an enquiry into the return. However, a taxpayer notice could be given where a notice of enquiry had been given and the enquiry was not completed (in other words the notice is part of the conduct of the enquiry) or where the WRA suspected an issue with the assessed tax liability (including any reliefs) for the transaction or accounting period (in other words the notice is part of the work the WRA does in making a WRA determination or WRA assessment). 
 The WRA may not require a person to provide or produce information or documents that are legally privileged. This refers to information or documents that benefit from the confidentiality that arises between a professional legal adviser and a client. Where there is a dispute, it is for a tribunal to determine whether or not material is privileged. There are also restrictions on the information and documents that a tax adviser or auditor may be required to provide: generally, tax advisers are not required to provide communication between themselves and their client; and auditors are not required to provide information relating to their audit function.

590,590,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9120 Overview of inspection powers," The WRA may enter premises and carry out inspections of them and of business assets and documents on the premises, when they have grounds for believing that this is required for the purposes of checking a person’s tax position. The WRA has no power under these provisions to use force to gain access to premises, but if a person refuses to permit access to premises for an inspection, they may be liable to penalties. When exercising powers of inspection, the WRA official must produce evidence of their authority to do so, when asked to do so by the occupier or any other person who appears to be in charge of the premises. Failure to produce this evidence means that the inspection must stop.

591,591,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9130 Power to inspect business premises," The WRA can enter premises (or part of a premises) that it considers are being used to carry on a business and inspect those premises (including assets and documents on them). It may do so where it has grounds for believing that the inspection is required for the purposes of checking a person‘s tax position. Such an inspection can only be carried out with either the agreement of the occupier of the premises or with the approval of the tribunal. 
 The WRA may undertake an inspection at any time it has agreed with the occupier or at a reasonable time if the inspection has been approved by the tribunal. If the WRA has not obtained the occupier’s agreement, it must give the occupier notice of the inspection 7 days before it is due to take place, unless the tribunal is satisfied that giving such notice would seriously prejudice tax collection or assessment. 
 The WRA may not be permitted to enter or inspect any part of premises that are used solely as a dwelling. 
 In order to check a person’s tax position in relation to Landfill Disposals Tax, the WRA may enter the business premises of a third person if WRA has grounds for believing that person is or has been involved in any capacity with the disposal of material that may be subject to LDT (either at an authorised landfill site or elsewhere).

592,592,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9140 Carrying out inspections," When carrying out an inspection, the WRA has a number of powers, including: taking any other person(s) with them onto the premises (including a police officer where it is believed that the inspection may be seriously obstructed); examining or investigating anything considered necessary in the circumstances of the inspection; directing that the premises (or any part of the premises) be left undisturbed for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of any examination or investigation; the power to take samples of materials from the premises, including by experimental borings or other works or the installation and maintenance of monitoring or other apparatus on the premises; and marking assets to show that they have been inspected. 
 The WRA may not inspect any documents that it would not be able to require through an information notice (for example, a document containing legally privileged material). 
 The WRA may, with the agreement of the occupier, also take equipment or materials required for the inspection on to the business premises. The WRA may take such equipment or material without the occupier’s agreement, either on service of a notice on the occupier (7 days in advance) or, if serving such a notice would seriously prejudice the assessment or collection of tax, without giving notice.

593,593,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9150 Power to inspect premises or property for valuation," The WRA may enter and inspect premises (including dwellings) and any property on the premises for the purpose of valuing, measuring or determining the character of the premises if it is required for the purposes of checking a person‘s tax position. 
 Such an inspection can only be carried out with either the agreement of the occupier (or a person who is in charge of the premises if the occupier cannot be identified), or the approval of the tribunal, (provided the occupier or person in charge has been given at least 7 days notice of the inspection).  
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
594,594,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9160 Approval of tribunal for inspection of premises," Where the occupier of the premises does not agree to allowing an inspection (or does not agree to the WRA exercising all of its powers during an inspection), the WRA can ask the tribunal to approve an inspection and exercise of the related powers. 
 The application to the tribunal can be made without notice and in such circumstances the tribunal must satisfy itself that the sending of a notice of the application might have prejudiced the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 In approving an inspection the tribunal must be satisfied that the inspection is required for the purposes of checking a person’s tax position. 
 In approving an inspection for valuation purposes, the tribunal has to be satisfied that the WRA gave both the person whose tax position is being checked and the occupier (if different and capable of being identified) a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the WRA and the WRA must give a summary of any representations to the tribunal. 
 The WRA has to carry out an inspection no later than 3 months after the tribunal’s approval or within any shorter period as specified by the tribunal.

595,595,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9170 Further investigatory powers," When inspecting premises, the WRA may copy, make extracts from, remove and retain a document for a reasonable period of time. Where it does so, and the person who produced the document so requests, the WRA must (at no charge to the person) provide a copy of the document and a receipt for it and a copy of it. 
 The WRA may access information or documents stored in electronic form and may inspect and check the operation of any computer or associated apparatus or material relevant to the document or information. 
 Any person obstructing the WRA or an inspector exercising the powers in subsections (3) and (5) is liable to a penalty under section 146.

596,596,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9180 Offences relating to information notices," It is an offence to conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of a document required by an information notice which has been approved by the tribunal (even if the person has appealed against the information notice or a requirement in it). 
 It is also an offence to conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of a document where the WRA has told a person that it intends to seek the tribunal’s agreement, but has not yet done so. 
 It is a defence where a person demonstrates that there was a reasonable excuse. A person who commits an offence under either of the sections is liable on summary conviction to a fine or on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to 2 years or to a fine (or both). In each case the court has discretion as to the amount of the fine.

597,597,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5000 Our approach to tax disputes," Our approach to tax disputes sets out how we will manage disputes with taxpayers. 
 A dispute arises where a taxpayer disagrees with a WRA decision. And intends to challenge it using their statutory rights to a review or appeal to the tribunal. 
 The objectives of our strategy  
 At the heart of our approach there are 5 key objectives:  
 
 Ensure the fairness of the Welsh tax system.  
 Ensure the right amount of tax is paid. 
 Resolve disputes in a cost-effective way.  
 Protect and test the legislation.  
 Influence customer behaviour.  
 
 How we’ll deliver these objectives  
 We want to minimise the risk of a dispute arising in the first instance. This means that our dispute strategy doesn’t begin when we issue an appealable decision. It begins at the start of a taxpayers’ interaction with us. 
 We will minimise the risk of a dispute arising by: 
 
 tailoring our approach to taxpayers 
 maximising opportunities to communicate with taxpayers clearly and in their preferred language 
 communicating throughout our engagement with a taxpayer 
 explaining our decisions clearly and in full 
 
 Sometimes, the taxpayer will choose to disagree with a decision and seek to challenge it. We will act quickly to resolve the dispute: 
 
 we will agree with a taxpayer what is not in dispute (such as facts or interpretation of the law) 
 we will continue to communicate throughout the dispute 
 
 Wherever possible we will settle cases by agreement. But we need to recognise this isn’t always possible. There will be times where we need to litigate to protect our position. 
 Once a dispute has closed, we will learn from it. 
 What this means for taxpayers 
 
 We’ll invest more time up front to prevent disputes. 
 We’ll seek to settle issues by agreement wherever possible. 
 We’ll never “split the difference”. 
 We’ll treat each individual issue on its merits. So, we won’t decide not to pursue one dispute if a taxpayer settles another. 
 We might litigate a dispute, even where there is a small amount of tax at stake. 
 We’ll take a hard line on evasion/ avoidance. We’ll reach agreement wherever possible but will not shy away from litigation to ensure Welsh taxes are applied in the way intended by the Welsh Parliament. 
 We’ll consider alternative dispute resolution to settle disputes where appropriate and cost-effective.

598,598,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5010 Reviewable and appealable decisions," Appealable decisions are those where the taxpayer may request a review of the decision or appeal against the decision. The following WRA decisions listed at section 172(2) TCMA are reviewable and appealable:

 If the WRA does not agree to review the decision, the taxpayer can apply to the tribunal for permission for their request. The application must include the reason why the notice of request was not provided in time. The tribunal will only direct the WRA to complete the review if there was a reasonable excuse for the request being late, if the subsequent request was made without unreasonable delay, and if the appeal to the tribunal was also made without unreasonable delay. 
 If the tribunal accepts the appeal and directs the WRA to undertake a review, the WRA must carry out the review.

The review will be carried out by a member of WRA staff who has not previously been involved in the matter. During the review, the WRA may want to contact the taxpayer to verify or clarify information as part of the review process. 
 The WRA must ensure it has a reasonable opportunity to consider any representations made by the person requesting the review. 
 In concluding the review, the WRA can affirm, vary or cancel the original decision which was under review. 
 The outcome of the review must be communicated to the person who requested it within 45 days of the WRA receiving the notice of request. It is possible to change the time period on the condition that the WRA and the person requesting the review both agree to the revised timing. 
 Where the tribunal has directed the WRA to carry out a review, the WRA must notify the person within 45 days of receiving the tribunal’s direction. This time period can be changed if the WRA and the person both agree. 
 If the WRA does not notify the person within 45 days, the review will be deemed to have concluded that the WRA’s decision is to be upheld. The WRA must notify the person who issued the notice of request that this is the outcome of the review.

 Postponement requests 
 If a person has requested a review or made an appeal against a WRA decision and they believe they have been charged an excessive amount of tax as a consequence of that decision, they may apply to the WRA for the recovery of the tax (and interest on that amount) to be postponed (‘a postponement request’). 
 This guidance summarises the key aspects of applying for a postponement request, but you may need to refer to the full legislative provisions at sections 181A-181J of the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016 if this topic is relevant to you. 
 Time for making postponement requests 
 Where a postponement request relates to a decision where a review has been or is being requested, the request must be made within the time allowed for requesting a review (this is often within 30 days of a decision being made but see TCMA/5040 for more information), or, if a late request for a review is made, the postponement request must be made at the same time. 
 Where a postponement request relates to a decision where an appeal has been or is being sought, the request must be made within the time allowed for requesting a review (this is often within 30 days of a decision being made or within 30 days of a WRA review conclusion being issued but see TCMA/5090 for more information), or, if the tribunal gives permission for a late appeal, the postponement request must be made at the same time as permission is sought. 
 Late postponement requests may also be considered by WRA if the person applying has a reasonable excuse for failing to make the request within the required timeframe and subsequently made the request without unreasonable delay. 
 Information that a postponement request should contain 
 When a postponement request is sent to WRA it must give the following information: 
 
 the amount of tax considered to be excessive 
 the reasons for believing the amount is excessive 
 
 When a postponement request relates to LDT, it also needs to specify the reasons why recovery of the amount (including any interest) would cause the person making the application financial hardship. 
 WRA must issue a notice of its decision on a postponement request to the person who made the request. 
 Granting a postponement request 
 WRA has the power to grant a postponement request if satisfied that the person has reasonable grounds for thinking the amount of devolved tax is excessive. In the case of an LDT postponement request, WRA will also need to have reason to believe that recovery would cause financial hardship. 
 WRA may grant a postponement request for part of an amount.  
 If approved, all or part of a postponement may be made conditional on the provision of additional security.  
 If a postponement request is not granted  
 If WRA does not grant a postponement request, this decision can be appealed to the Tribunal. The appeal must be made within 30 days of WRA issuing the decision. The Tribunal may affirm, cancel or replace WRA’s decision.  
 Varying a postponement decision 
 After a postponement request has been granted it may be varied if there is a change in circumstances. This could involve changing the amount of tax postponed or conditions attached to the postponement. Either WRA or the taxpayer may request a variation and it must be agreed by both parties. If agreed, the WRA will issue a notice to the taxpayer of this decision.  
 If agreement cannot be reached within 21 days of the request for a variation, the taxpayer or the WRA can apply to the Tribunal for a determination on the variation. The Tribunal can refuse or agree the variation or propose their own variation. 
 Recovery of tax during postponement period 
 Once a postponement request is granted, the WRA cannot seek to recover any postponed amount of tax during the postponement period. The postponement period will usually begin on the day on which the postponement request is made and end on the day on which the relevant review or appeal is concluded.  
 There may be scope for further postponement requests if further appeals are made to the Tribunal.

610,610,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5130 Consequences of reviews and appeals," Payment of penalties in the event of a review or appeal 
 Where the WRA carries out a review into an amount of penalty that is disputed by a taxpayer and the review concludes that the taxpayer is liable, the taxpayer has to pay the penalty within 30 days of the date the notice informing them of the outcome of the review was issued. 
 If the taxpayer appeals against the decision, but subsequently withdraws the appeal, they must pay the penalty within 30 days of the date of the withdrawal. 
 If the result of the appeal is that the taxpayer is liable, they must pay the penalty within 30 days of the date that the appeal was determined. 
 Disposal of reviews and appeals in respect of information notices 
 Where a review concludes that an information notice will be upheld or varied, the notice recipient must comply with the information notice within a time period to be determined by the WRA. 
 If the tribunal upholds or varies an information notice, the notice recipient must comply with the notice within a time period set by either the tribunal or the WRA. 
 Suspension of repayments pending further appeal 
 If the tribunal determines that an amount of tax needs to be repaid to the taxpayer following an appeal, the WRA may request permission from the tribunal to postpone repayment of the amount until a further appeal is determined or the WRA is able to obtain security for the amount. The tribunal must agree to the request if it gives permission for a further appeal, or if it thinks the postponement is needed to protect the revenue. 
 If the tribunal does not agree to the WRA’s request for a further appeal, the WRA may make seek permissions to make a further appeal under sections 11(4)(b) (to the Upper Tribunal) or 13(4)(b) (to another appellate court) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.Otherwise the decision of the tribunal is final.

611,611,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5140 Settlement agreements," The WRA and the taxpayer can enter into a settlement agreement, which can uphold, vary or cancel the original decision which is the subject of the review or appeal. 
 The effect or consequences of a settlement agreement are the same as if the tribunal had determined an appeal in relation to the matter in question by upholding, varying or cancelling the decision (whichever applies). However, a settlement agreement is not treated as a decision of the tribunal for the purposes of sections 9 and 10 (Review of decisions of First-tier and Upper Tribunals), 11 (Right to appeal to Upper Tribunal), 12 (Proceedings on appeal to Upper Tribunal) and 13 (Right to appeal to Court of Appeal of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.) 
 The above paragraph does not apply: 
 
 where the taxpayer withdraws from the settlement agreement by notifying the WRA within 30 days from the day when they entered into the settlement agreement, or 
 where the settlement agreement is not in writing, unless the fact that an agreement was entered into, and the terms agreed, are confirmed by a notice in writing from either the WRA to the taxpayer or the taxpayer to the WRA. 
 
 A settlement agreement may not be entered into in relation to an appealable decision, if an appeal has been finally determined.

612,612,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8010 Purpose and status of this guidance," The General Anti-avoidance Rule (‘GAAR’) applies to Welsh devolved taxes. The devolved taxes are land transaction tax (‘LTT’) and landfill disposals tax (‘LDT’). The UK General Anti-Abuse Rule does not apply to the Welsh devolved taxes. 
 It should be noted that whilst there are similarities between the GAAR that operates in relation to the Welsh devolved taxes and the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule and Scottish General Anti-Avoidance Rule it contains a number of distinct differences from both these rules. It is therefore important when considering the application of the GAAR to the devolved taxes that taxpayers, their advisers and the WRA staff are fully aware of the legislation which is found in Part 3A of the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016 (sections 81A to 81I), and this guidance. 
 This guidance has 3 main objectives: 
 
 to give a broad summary of what the GAAR is designed to achieve, and how the GAAR operates to achieve it 
 to help with the interpretation and application of the GAAR, by discussing its purpose, considering particular features of the GAAR and, where appropriate, illustrating that discussion by means of examples, and 
 setting out how the GAAR will be used by WRA to counteract avoidance activity 
 
 Whilst the guidance is intended to be a helpful tool for taxpayers, it cannot provide complete clarity or certainty. The GAAR is intended to catch situations or transactions that were not specifically considered or anticipated at the time of its enactment. If there is doubt as to whether a particular transaction may be caught by the GAAR, taxpayers should exercise caution and anticipate that the WRA will seek to proactively apply a wide interpretation of the GAAR. 
 Unlike the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule, this guidance is not specifically referred to in the legislation. There is no requirement akin to Section 211(2) of Finance Act (FA) 2013, which requires any court or tribunal which is considering the application of the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule to take into account the HMRC guidance. 
 It will be for the court or tribunal to decide what evidence to consider and what significance is to be given to this guidance in any proceedings in relation to the application of the GAAR. 
 The guidance is tailored to the Welsh devolved taxes. The partial devolution of income tax to Wales will not be covered by the GAAR as income tax will remain under the administration of HMRC and the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule will continue to apply. 
 Guidance is also provided in relation to the procedural aspects of the operation of the GAAR. This includes the making, by the WRA, of proposed and final counteraction notices and how adjustments to bring any tax to be assessed under the GAAR will be effected.

613,613,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8020 What the GAAR is designed to achieve," The enacting of the GAAR by the National Assembly for Wales (‘the Assembly’) is a clear statement that no-one will be permitted to limit their liability to devolved taxes by engaging in artificial tax avoidance. 
 Rather, the Assembly has imposed a statutory limit to the extent a taxpayer can go when trying to limit their liability to tax. A taxpayer who enters into artificial tax avoidance arrangements that do not constitute a reasonable course of action may find that the GAAR is used to counter their tax planning. 
 The primary purpose of the GAAR is to provide the WRA with a robust tool to tackle artificial arrangements that create a tax advantage that the Assembly did not intend when enacting the relevant legislation. The GAAR should therefore, primarily, deter taxpayers from entering such arrangements. 
 The GAAR is not intended to stop taxpayers arranging their affairs to, for example, claim reliefs that the Assembly intends to be claimed. However, a taxpayer arranging their affairs in an artificial way to put themselves, or another taxpayer, in a position to claim a relief that would not otherwise have been available to them may find that the GAAR will be used to counteract the tax advantage gained.

614,614,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8030 Arrangements which are caught by the GAAR," The GAAR provides the WRA with a power to counteract a “tax advantage” deriving from an “artificial tax avoidance arrangement”. The 3 elements of this (“tax advantage”, “artificial” and “tax avoidance arrangements”) have been defined in the TCMA at sections 81D, 81C and 81B respectively. 
 The meaning of “tax advantage” 
 In the GAAR, a “tax advantage” can only mean one of the things listed in section 81D. These are: 
 
 the claiming of a relief or an increased relief from tax 
 the repayment of or an increased repayment of tax 
 the avoidance or the reduction of a charge to tax 
 the deferral of a payment of tax or the advancement of a repayment of tax, and 
 the avoidance of an obligation to deduct or account for tax 
 
 The meaning of “tax avoidance arrangements” 
 Section 81B(1) provides that an arrangement is a “tax avoidance arrangement” if: 
 
 “the obtaining of a tax advantage for any person is the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of a taxpayer entering into the arrangement”. 
 
 In order for a taxpayer’s affairs to potentially be counteracted by the GAAR the taxpayer must have sought to obtain an advantage for themselves or another person by, for example, paying less tax, making a claim to repayment or delaying the payment of tax. The obtaining of that advantage must have been the main or one of the main reasons for including or structuring the arrangements in the manner that resulted in the advantage. 
 The test therefore covers situations where the main purpose was the obtaining of the tax advantage and cases where the obtaining of the tax advantage was one of the main purposes. In many cases, for example in land transaction tax, the main purpose may be obtaining ownership of the land. 
 However, if arrangements are structured in such a way that they result in, for example, no or less tax being payable than would otherwise have been absent those arrangements, then the reduction of the tax liability is likely to be one of the main reasons for the arrangements being entered into. When determining whether the arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements, the tax that would have been payable (or not repayable) if the arrangements had not been entered into is an important factor. Therefore if tax would have been payable absent the arrangements, then in the absence of other evidence, this may indicate that they are tax avoidance arrangements. 
 The main, or one of the main, purposes test 
 The definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” includes cases where “the main, or one of the main, purposes” (‘main purpose test’) of entering into the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage. 
 In applying the GAAR the WRA will give consideration to the decisions of the courts and tribunals in regard to the meaning of main purpose and one of the main purposes. 
 It should be noted that the “main purpose” test does not operate in isolation, as the tax avoidance arrangements must also be artificial. 
 Meaning of “arrangement” 
 The definition of an arrangement for the purposes of the GAAR is wide and includes (in section 81B(3)(a)) any: 
 
 transaction 
 scheme 
 action 
 operation 
 agreement 
 grant 
 understanding 
 promise 
 undertaking 
 event 
 
 The definition also includes any series of the above either of one of the list (for example, a series of transactions) or in combination with one or more of the other listed arrangements. 
 The GAAR applies to all Welsh devolved taxes, the definition of “arrangement” therefore ensures that avoidance arrangements involving landfill disposals tax (which might involve a particular “event” or an individual undertaking a particular “action” or “operation”) are also within the scope of the GAAR. 
 Meaning of “artificial” 
 A tax avoidance arrangement will be “artificial” if entering into it or carrying it out is not a reasonable course of action in relation to the legislative provisions applying to the arrangements. 
 Section 81C(2) sets out 2 of the factors which might be taken into account when deciding whether an arrangement is artificial: 
 
 Does the arrangement have any “genuine economic or commercial substance”? 
 Having regard to whether the arrangement has “any genuine economic or commercial substance” enables the WRA (and therefore the taxpayer and ultimately any tribunal or court) to consider the reasons behind the structure of the transaction. Other targeted anti-avoidance rules (“TAARs”) on the UK statute book already operate by reference to whether an arrangement has a “genuine commercial substance” (For example, sections 455 and 446A of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and regulation 4(2) of the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Prescribed Arrangements) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3315)), or “bona fide commercial purpose” and practitioners and the judiciary will be familiar with undertaking an assessment as to whether an arrangement has “commercial substance” (For example, paragraphs 2(4A) and 8(5B). Schedule 7 of the Finance Act 2003 and section 734 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, and the Supreme Court judgment in UBS AG v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2016] UKSC 13). The WRA will give consideration to decisions of the courts and tribunals on the meaning of the tests where the wording is identical or similar to the wording in the GAAR. 
 The question of whether an arrangement has any “economic” or “commercial” substance will be one of fact, and it will be for the taxpayer when completing their return to decide whether there was any economic or commercial substance behind the arrangement and the structure created. 
 In many cases, the commercial or economic substance of an arrangement will be clearly apparent. For example, in a case where the buyer of land can purchase that land directly in a simple A-B transaction, the taxpayer will achieve their economic and commercial aim (of owning the land) and will not have entered into any arrangements that could be considered artificial or lacking in genuine economic or commercial substance. However, where the buyer enters into a more convoluted, and a more costly (except for any tax advantage), way to obtain the land, it is an indicator that the arrangement may lack genuine commercial substance. This is because, absent the tax advantage, it is reasonable to argue that the buyer would not have incurred that additional cost having regard to the economic and commercial objectives of acquiring the land. 
 The rule looks at the “economic” substance, for example, the acquisition of a plot of land of historical importance by a charity may be motivated by that charity’s desire to further its charitable objectives and protect the land in question, rather than for commercial reasons. Furthermore, in land transaction tax some of the reliefs relating to relief for certain transactions relating to social housing (Schedule 14) are likely to have economic substance (home ownership achieved through the giving of consideration for the homer) rather than commercial substance. 
 
 Does the arrangement result in an amount of tax chargeable that was not the anticipated result of the relevant provisions when enacted? 
 The National Assembly for Wales, when passing tax legislation, will have expected that tax will be paid, and reliefs claimed, in accordance with the intention of the legislation. If there are circumstances where the taxpayer, for example, claims relief that results in a lower amount of tax than would have been paid absent the arrangements then it is possible that those arrangements do not result in the anticipated amount of tax being paid. 
 Therefore, if a person is able, as a result of the arrangements, to claim a relief which it was not anticipated they should be able to claim, perhaps as a result of convoluted arrangements, then the GAAR provisions may be engaged. The GAAR is independent of the other anti-avoidance rules, and may be used to challenge an artificial arrangement which was itself contrived to exploit a defect, or perceived defect, in the other anti-avoidance rules. 
 
 
 It is important to note that there may be other relevant factors, but this will depend on the nature and circumstances of the arrangement. Each case will need to be considered on its facts.

615,615,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8040 Generally prevailing practice," Section 81C(3) is designed to provide taxpayers with a ‘shield’ against any claim by the WRA that an arrangement is artificial in cases where the arrangement is consistent with generally prevailing practice, and that practice had been accepted by the WRA. This rule is a means of providing additional protection to taxpayers: it would be wrong for the WRA to attempt to recover tax that has been avoided if the WRA had previously indicated that the arrangement was acceptable. 
 The generally prevailing practice rule provided in section 81C(3) provides an absolute bar against an arrangement being classed as “artificial” in the context of the GAAR. 
 However, a key point is that the generally prevailing practice must have been something that the WRA is aware of and has indicated that it accepts that the arrangements fall outside the scope of the GAAR. The WRA will have regard to case law that indicates what constitutes generally prevailing practice, such as it not including common misunderstandings of the application of the law. Furthermore, if a set of arrangements that obtains a tax advantage is considered by taxpayers or advisers to be generally prevailing practice, it will not be generally prevailing practice affording taxpayers protection under section 81C(3) if the WRA is not aware of the practice or is aware but has not indicated that it accepts that practice in writing.

616,616,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8050 Is the Welsh GAAR wider than the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule?," It is not considered that the Welsh GAAR is substantively wider than the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule. Apart from the different terminology “artificial” and “abusive”, the key difference between the Welsh GAARs as compared to the UK General Anti-Avoidance Rule is the “double-reasonableness” test. In common with the Scottish General Anti Avoidance Rule, the GAAR does not adopt this rule because, as a public authority, the WRA will be bound by normal public law principles, including the requirement to act reasonably. A statutory bar on the WRA counteracting an arrangement, where it unreasonably considers that the arrangement is caught by the GAAR is unnecessary.

617,617,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8060 The GAAR and WRA tax opinions," Where a taxpayer obtains a tax opinion from the WRA on the operation of the devolved taxes in accordance with the rules at  WRA Tax Opinions Service(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority-tax-opinion-service)  then they should be able to rely upon the WRA view of the operation of the legislation based on the information that the taxpayer has provided. 
 The WRA will not provide a tax opinion on the application of the GAAR. If a request for a tax opinion references the application of the GAAR to a transaction we will disregard this element of the request in our response and set out our opinion on the tax consequences of the specific circumstances or transactions in the absence of the GAAR. 
 Furthermore, a taxpayer will not be able to rely on a WRA tax opinion where a view is sought in relation to one part of an arrangement, or in relation to one arrangement that is linked to other arrangements, which is intended or might be expected to achieve the avoidance of tax. In requesting an opinion a taxpayer must provide the full details of their transaction. 
 The Welsh Revenue Authority(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) is committed to helping taxpayers pay the right amount of tax, at the right time. If a taxpayer has entered into an arrangement or is considering doing so and a devolved tax advantage might be expected to be a main benefit, we will provide an opinion on the technical aspects of that arrangement. We will not however give a view on whether it amounts to the avoidance of a devolved tax. 
 The WRA will not provide tax planning advice, nor opinions on speculative, hypothetical or “what if” requests. 
A taxpayer cannot therefore rely on a tax opinion in respect of the application of the GAAR to a transaction. It remains the responsibility of the taxpayer to self- assess the transaction in respect of the GAAR. After a return has been filed, where appropriate the WRA may seek to apply the GAAR to the transaction, which could change the tax position. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 – GAAR does not apply - Extension of a long lease 
 
 
   
 A Ltd has leased a property to B Ltd, a connected person. B Ltd wishes to lengthen the lease (to 35 years) which is assumed to have a further term of 20 years. A Ltd could agree that in consideration of A Ltd accepting B Ltd’s surrender (and B Ltd’s agreement that it will take a lease from A Ltd) that A Ltd will grant B Ltd a new 35 year lease. A Ltd and B Ltd take tax advice and decide instead that A Ltd will grant a 15 year reversionary lease to B Ltd (that is, a 15 year lease which commences when B Ltd’s lease expires in 20 years’ time). 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd agrees to grant a reversionary lease to B Ltd. The lease terms (apart from the commencement date) could be the same or A Ltd could choose to charge a higher rent under the new lease than it currently charges under the existing lease. 
 Accordingly, B Ltd holds 2 consecutive leases from A Ltd, one for 20 years and the 2nd for 15 years. 
 The relevant tax provisions 
 Sections 18 and 22, paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 and paras 7 and 17 Schedule 6. 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The only LTT liability is on the rent payable under the new lease for the new term of 15 years. 
 Had the transaction been carried out by B Ltd surrendering to A Ltd and A Ltd granting a new lease for 35 years then the taxpayer would assert: 
 
 Para 17 Schedule 6 has the effect that the value of B Ltd’s existing lease which B Ltd surrenders is not consideration (a non-monetary premium) for the grant of the new lease by A Ltd and that the value of A Ltd’s promise to grant a new lease to B Ltd is not consideration for the surrender of B Ltd’s old lease.  
 If the old lease had attracted LTT (or SDLT as provided in regulation 9 of the Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018) then it would only be due on the additional rent under the new lease compared with the amount paid under the old lease (if the old lease had attracted stamp duty no ’overlap relief’ would be available so that LTT would be due on 35 years rent). 
 
 As A Ltd and B Ltd are connected persons the consideration is not less than the market value and that the specific provision in paragraph 17 (providing that the new lease is not chargeable consideration for the surrender of the old lease and the value of the old lease does not constitute chargeable consideration for the new lease) has no effect. Furthermore, as para 7(2) Schedule 6 (“for the purpose of this Act”) means that the rent is taken to be reduced by the operation of paragraph 7, that is, LTT is charged on rent as reduced by any overlap relief. 
 The GAAR analysis 
 Are the substantive results of the arrangements consistent with any principles on which the relevant tax provisions are based (whether express or implied) and the policy objectives of those provisions? 
 The LTT provisions are designed to charge transactions where interests in land are acquired, whether by grant, transfer or surrender; and to impose LTT on the consideration provided for the grant or assignment of leases. 
 For the rent, it could be said that by structuring the new lease as a reversionary lease, LTT on the new lease is reduced as compared with the LTT that would have been payable under a new 35 year lease where the old lease had attracted stamp duty. 
 The taxpayer could argue that it has a choice under land law operating in Wales whether to surrender and obtain a re-grant of a 35 year lease or retain the old lease and obtain a new 15 year lease. 
 The decision whether to surrender and re-grant, while it could be said that the policy objective is to impose LTT at a minimum by reference to market values where transactions are between connected persons, as a general rule (such as section 22) is subject to any specific statutory provision also dealing with consideration. 
 A reasonable view of these transactions is that they are consistent with policy and principles. 
 Do the means of achieving the substantive tax results involve one or more artificial arrangements? 
 
 Surrenders and re-grants, and the grant of reversionary leases as part of portfolio management, are not artificial steps 
 
 Are the arrangements intended to exploit any shortcomings in the relevant tax provisions? 
 
 No 
 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are not such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 – GAAR does apply - Higher rates residential property transactions (acquisition of freehold and grant of lease to effect arrangements to avoid tax) 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to provide an example of artificial tax avoidance arrangements. 
 Background 
 The LTTA introduces higher rates of LTT for certain residential property transactions. 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd acquires an major interest in a freehold dwelling (‘A dwelling’) on a new development. On the same day as it completes its acquisition of that interest it grants a lease for 22 years to B Ltd. A Ltd and B Ltd are unconnected but have a long but not interdependent business association. They both have substantial buy-to-let portfolios. B Ltd is also acquiring a near identical dwelling (‘B dwelling’) on the new development. It times its completion of its dwelling to fall on the same day as A Ltd’s completion. On the same day it grants a lease to A Ltd for 22 years. 
 At the end of the effective date of the 4 transactions A Ltd has a 22 year lease in B dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in A dwelling, and B Ltd has a 22 year lease in A dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in B dwelling. The granting of the leases is at a peppercorn rent. However, as they are an exchange, one lease is entered into in consideration for the other, the chargeable consideration for the leases will be the market value of the leases. 
 The terms of the leases include clauses that provide that where one lease is surrendered or disposed of that the other lease must be surrendered for the same consideration as the surrender or disposal of the lease achieved. They also contain clauses that ensure the dwellings are returned in good condition. 
 The freehold dwellings cost A Ltd and B Ltd £150,000 each (tax at higher rates £4,500, tax at normal rates zero). The leases have, given the peppercorn rent, a market value for the premium of £60,000 (tax at higher rates £1,800, tax at normal rates zero). 
 A Ltd seeks to find a tenant for B dwelling and B Ltd seeks a tenant for A dwelling. 
 The relevant provisions 
 Paragraph 20(2) of Schedule 5, section 16 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The taxpayers contend that they are liable to tax on the LTT higher rates only on the purchase of the leases and not on the freehold acquisitions. This is because at the end of the effective date the acquisition is subject to a lease held by an unconnected person and that lease has an unexpired term of more than 21 years. 
 A Ltd therefore contends that it is liable to tax on the acquisition of the freehold at normal rates (zero) and on the acquisition of the lease at LTT higher rates (£1,800). B Ltd contends that its tax position is identical.  
 The GAAR analysis 
 The WRA considers that the GAAR will be triggered. The arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements as the obtaining of the tax advantage (the reduction of a charge to tax) was, at the very least, certainly one of the main reasons (and probably the main reason) for the arrangements. 
 Those arrangements are also are also artificial arrangements that lack genuine commercial substance. The acquisition of the freehold interests have genuine commercial substance, whereas the peppercorn rent leases (even when the market value of the premium is taxed as chargeable consideration) do not have commercial substance. They are risk free (in that if A Ltd is unable to let B dwelling it incurs no rent payments and has paid no premium – it is in the same position as if it had retained its unencumbered interest in A dwelling and had been unable to let that property). 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 The application of the GAAR to in this case would result in A Ltd and B Ltd being taxed on the acquisition of the freehold interest of A dwelling and B dwelling respectively (a liability to LTT of £4,500 each rather than £1,800 each). The transactions related to the leases will be ignored for LTT purposes.

 A Ltd agrees to grant a reversionary lease to B Ltd. The lease terms (apart from the commencement date) could be the same or A Ltd could choose to charge a higher rent under the new lease than it currently charges under the existing lease. 
 Accordingly, B Ltd holds 2 consecutive leases from A Ltd, one for 20 years and the 2nd for 15 years. 
 The relevant tax provisions 
 Sections 18 and 22, paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 and paras 7 and 17 Schedule 6. 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The only LTT liability is on the rent payable under the new lease for the new term of 15 years. 
 Had the transaction been carried out by B Ltd surrendering to A Ltd and A Ltd granting a new lease for 35 years then the taxpayer would assert: 
 
 Para 17 Schedule 6 has the effect that the value of B Ltd’s existing lease which B Ltd surrenders is not consideration (a non-monetary premium) for the grant of the new lease by A Ltd and that the value of A Ltd’s promise to grant a new lease to B Ltd is not consideration for the surrender of B Ltd’s old lease.  
 If the old lease had attracted LTT (or SDLT as provided in regulation 9 of the Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018) then it would only be due on the additional rent under the new lease compared with the amount paid under the old lease (if the old lease had attracted stamp duty no ’overlap relief’ would be available so that LTT would be due on 35 years rent). 
 
 As A Ltd and B Ltd are connected persons the consideration is not less than the market value and that the specific provision in paragraph 17 (providing that the new lease is not chargeable consideration for the surrender of the old lease and the value of the old lease does not constitute chargeable consideration for the new lease) has no effect. Furthermore, as para 7(2) Schedule 6 (“for the purpose of this Act”) means that the rent is taken to be reduced by the operation of paragraph 7, that is, LTT is charged on rent as reduced by any overlap relief. 
 The GAAR analysis 
 Are the substantive results of the arrangements consistent with any principles on which the relevant tax provisions are based (whether express or implied) and the policy objectives of those provisions? 
 The LTT provisions are designed to charge transactions where interests in land are acquired, whether by grant, transfer or surrender; and to impose LTT on the consideration provided for the grant or assignment of leases. 
 For the rent, it could be said that by structuring the new lease as a reversionary lease, LTT on the new lease is reduced as compared with the LTT that would have been payable under a new 35 year lease where the old lease had attracted stamp duty. 
 The taxpayer could argue that it has a choice under land law operating in Wales whether to surrender and obtain a re-grant of a 35 year lease or retain the old lease and obtain a new 15 year lease. 
 The decision whether to surrender and re-grant, while it could be said that the policy objective is to impose LTT at a minimum by reference to market values where transactions are between connected persons, as a general rule (such as section 22) is subject to any specific statutory provision also dealing with consideration. 
 A reasonable view of these transactions is that they are consistent with policy and principles. 
 Do the means of achieving the substantive tax results involve one or more artificial arrangements? 
 
 Surrenders and re-grants, and the grant of reversionary leases as part of portfolio management, are not artificial steps 
 
 Are the arrangements intended to exploit any shortcomings in the relevant tax provisions? 
 
 No 
 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are not such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 
 Example 2 – GAAR does apply - Higher rates residential property transactions (acquisition of freehold and grant of lease to effect arrangements to avoid tax) 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to provide an example of artificial tax avoidance arrangements. 
 Background 
 The LTTA introduces higher rates of LTT for certain residential property transactions. 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd acquires an major interest in a freehold dwelling (‘A dwelling’) on a new development. On the same day as it completes its acquisition of that interest it grants a lease for 22 years to B Ltd. A Ltd and B Ltd are unconnected but have a long but not interdependent business association. They both have substantial buy-to-let portfolios. B Ltd is also acquiring a near identical dwelling (‘B dwelling’) on the new development. It times its completion of its dwelling to fall on the same day as A Ltd’s completion. On the same day it grants a lease to A Ltd for 22 years. 
 At the end of the effective date of the 4 transactions A Ltd has a 22 year lease in B dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in A dwelling, and B Ltd has a 22 year lease in A dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in B dwelling. The granting of the leases is at a peppercorn rent. However, as they are an exchange, one lease is entered into in consideration for the other, the chargeable consideration for the leases will be the market value of the leases. 
 The terms of the leases include clauses that provide that where one lease is surrendered or disposed of that the other lease must be surrendered for the same consideration as the surrender or disposal of the lease achieved. They also contain clauses that ensure the dwellings are returned in good condition. 
 The freehold dwellings cost A Ltd and B Ltd £150,000 each (tax at higher rates £4,500, tax at normal rates zero). The leases have, given the peppercorn rent, a market value for the premium of £60,000 (tax at higher rates £1,800, tax at normal rates zero). 
 A Ltd seeks to find a tenant for B dwelling and B Ltd seeks a tenant for A dwelling. 
 The relevant provisions 
 Paragraph 20(2) of Schedule 5, section 16 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The taxpayers contend that they are liable to tax on the LTT higher rates only on the purchase of the leases and not on the freehold acquisitions. This is because at the end of the effective date the acquisition is subject to a lease held by an unconnected person and that lease has an unexpired term of more than 21 years. 
 A Ltd therefore contends that it is liable to tax on the acquisition of the freehold at normal rates (zero) and on the acquisition of the lease at LTT higher rates (£1,800). B Ltd contends that its tax position is identical.  
 The GAAR analysis 
 The WRA considers that the GAAR will be triggered. The arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements as the obtaining of the tax advantage (the reduction of a charge to tax) was, at the very least, certainly one of the main reasons (and probably the main reason) for the arrangements. 
 Those arrangements are also are also artificial arrangements that lack genuine commercial substance. The acquisition of the freehold interests have genuine commercial substance, whereas the peppercorn rent leases (even when the market value of the premium is taxed as chargeable consideration) do not have commercial substance. They are risk free (in that if A Ltd is unable to let B dwelling it incurs no rent payments and has paid no premium – it is in the same position as if it had retained its unencumbered interest in A dwelling and had been unable to let that property). 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 The application of the GAAR to in this case would result in A Ltd and B Ltd being taxed on the acquisition of the freehold interest of A dwelling and B dwelling respectively (a liability to LTT of £4,500 each rather than £1,800 each). The transactions related to the leases will be ignored for LTT purposes.

618,618,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8070 The GAAR and other devolved tax rules," The GAAR is designed to counteract tax advantages which arise as a result of the artificial tax avoidance arrangements that have been used by the taxpayer. The WRA must therefore conclude that the arrangements are artificial before taking action to counteract the tax advantage using the GAAR. 
 It is likely that a taxpayer will already be under enquiry before the WRA will advance an argument that the taxpayer has potentially triggered the GAAR. The WRA, prior to advancing arguments under the GAAR, may have already advanced arguments under other areas of the devolved taxation legislation to challenge the tax result the taxpayer has sought to achieve. Therefore, in such enquiries the WRA may run a number of arguments with different tax results and, potentially, with different taxpayers being liable to the tax (depending upon the arrangements in question). 
 There may be some arrangements which appear to be so clearly artificial that it would be appropriate for the WRA to commence its enquiry with the intention of demonstrating that the GAAR has been triggered. This may be the case where evidence emerges that a taxpayer has entered into the same arrangements as another taxpayer (for example if an avoidance scheme has been mass marketed) and a GAAR challenge is already running in that other enquiry. 
 Whilst multiple arguments based on other areas of the devolved tax legislation may be possible, the WRA can choose to use only a GAAR challenge. A taxpayer cannot object to the use of the GAAR simply because other means available to the WRA to challenge the artificial arrangement have not been used. 
 Other statutory provisions relating to devolved taxes contain specific anti-avoidance rules. Some of these are known as targeted anti-avoidance rules (TAARs), while others may take the form of less explicit anti-avoidance protection. In relation to LTT, the most significant is the rule at section 31 LTTA which is targeted to stop claims using tax avoidance arrangements to access the relief. 
 The GAAR is independent of the other anti-avoidance rules, and it might be used to challenge an artificial arrangement which was itself contrived to exploit a defect, or perceived defect, in the other anti-avoidance rules.

619,619,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8080 Commencement of the GAAR and the Transitional rule," The GAAR will only apply to those tax avoidance arrangements entered into on or after the date on which the GAAR came into force. This is 1 April 2018. 
 This means that the WRA cannot consider or have regard to any arrangements entered into before that date to make a challenge using the GAAR. However, other challenges using other parts of the Welsh Taxes Acts may still be possible. 
 Conversely, a taxpayer will be able to have regard and make reference to arrangements entered into before 1 April 2018 if that will assist the taxpayer in showing that the tax avoidance arrangements were not artificial. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-general-anti-avoidance-rule-technical-guidance
620,620,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8090 How will the WRA counteract an advantage?," If the WRA considers that an arrangement is artificial and that the GAAR is to be used to counteract the tax avoidance arrangements, whether alone or together with other challenges to the arrangements (for example a specific TAAR), then the WRA must follow the procedures set out in the GAAR legislation.  
 Section 81E TCMA 2016 sets out that any adjustment made by the WRA must be just and reasonable to counteract the tax advantage. In most cases this should be a relatively straightforward task to decide what adjustments need to be made to achieve that just and reasonable result. For example, in LTT where a taxpayer has entered into tax avoidance arrangements that have reduced their liability to zero, where consideration given for the subject matter of the land transaction would have resulted in a liability of £100,000, then the £100,000 liability will be sought through the counteraction notice. 
 However, if the tax avoidance arrangements were complicated then there may be a number of points at which the GAAR could result in a tax charge. If the WRA were to seek the tax charge at each point the tax result could be greater than if the artificial arrangements had not been entered in to at all. Using the LTT example in the previous paragraph if the tax avoidance arrangements resulted in multiple transactions (each of which the taxpayer contended resulted in a zero liability) then, had the taxpayer not entered in to the arrangements and had simply acquired the property from the seller directly, then the WRA will not seek tax for each and every transaction arising from the arrangements but will seek to tax the most likely or appropriate alternative transaction. That alternative transaction or arrangement may not be the one that would result in the highest tax charge. 
 In order to protect its position, the WRA may make more than one counteraction, with associated assessments and closure notices. This is because, in the event of appeal, the WRA may wish to present the tribunal with alternative tax consequences and, even, potentially different persons bearing the liability to tax. Ultimately the WRA must ensure that the adjustments do not involve any element of double taxation (whether for the taxpayer who carried out the artificial transaction(s), or when taking account of the tax liabilities of other persons).

621,621,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8100 The GAAR and self-assessed tax regimes," The devolved taxes are self-assessed taxes; the taxpayer assesses and informs the WRA what their tax liability is through a return. The GAAR forms part of the legislative framework for the devolved taxes. As the devolved taxes operate on a basis of self-assessment, taxpayers are required to take the provisions of the GAAR into account when completing their tax returns.

622,622,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8110 The GAAR and penalties," The Welsh Taxes Acts do not include any specific provisions imposing penalties counteracted by the GAAR. However, under the general principles of self-assessment, a taxpayer has a duty to submit a correct tax return. 
 Therefore, if a taxpayer considers that they have entered into arrangements that are artificial, then their tax return must make an appropriate adjustment to reflect the fact that the GAAR is applicable. Failure to make an appropriate adjustment could mean the taxpayer has committed an offence by submitting a return containing inaccuracies and they are liable to a penalty on the inaccuracy. 
 A taxpayer who is uncertain whether an arrangement is within the scope of the GAAR may wish to contact the WRA at the time the return is submitted, indicating the uncertainty. In such circumstances, the taxpayer is advised to make a full disclosure of all the relevant facts. Whilst penalties for inaccuracies may still be due, depending upon the specific facts of the tax avoidance arrangements, the full disclosure of the facts may provide grounds for mitigation of any penalty chargeable. The penalty will be based on the potential lost revenue as a result of the tax avoidance arrangements. 
 In the event that tax avoidance arrangements have been implemented incorrectly, so that the tax advantage that was sought by entering into the arrangements could not been achieved, then penalties for inaccuracies in the return will, where appropriate, be sought.

623,623,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8120 Counteraction notices," The WRA must follow the procedure set out in sections 81E to 81G when using the GAAR to counteract tax avoidance arrangements. In many enquiries the use of the GAAR may be one of a number of arguments advanced by the WRA to challenge the taxpayer’s self-assessment. Furthermore, the decision to advance GAAR arguments may come at a point in an enquiry when the WRA has already made an assessment based on technical arguments rather than the GAAR. 
 Whilst there is a need to use the counteraction notice procedure, the tax charged will continue to be assessed through a closure notice where there is an open enquiry, or by a WRA assessment. It is therefore important that when making the closure notice that all alternative tax results are fully set out. It is also possible, when considering making an assessment or a determination, for the WRA to consider whether the taxpayer may have entered into tax avoidance arrangements that the WRA may want to challenge using the GAAR.

624,624,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8130 Proposed counteraction notice," The WRA must issue the taxpayer with a proposed counteraction notice which states that the WRA considers a tax advantage to have arisen from an artificial tax avoidance arrangement and that the tax advantage is to be counteracted by an adjustment effected either by assessment or a closure notice. 
 The proposed counteraction notice must: 
 
 specify the tax avoidance arrangement and the tax advantage, 
 explain why the WRA considers that a tax advantage has arisen from the artificial tax avoidance arrangement, 
 set out the WRA proposed adjustments to counteract the tax advantage, and 
 specify the amount that the taxpayer will be required to pay in accordance with the proposed assessment (this should include tax arising under the GAAR counteraction and any other tax arising from other the WRA action, for example challenges to other aspects of the taxpayers affairs) 
 
 The proposed counteraction notice must also inform the taxpayer: 
 
 that a final counteraction notice will be issued after the expiry of a period of 45 days from the date of issue of the proposed counteraction notice, 
 that the taxpayer can ask the WRA to consider extending that 45 day period, and 
 that the taxpayer may make written representations at anytime in that 45 day (or as extended) period 
 
 The provision of the 45 day period for the taxpayer to make written representations is to enable the taxpayer to challenge the WRA conclusions that an artificial tax avoidance arrangement has given rise to a tax advantage. Following the expiry of that period, and if the WRA’s view has not been altered by the taxpayers written representations, then the WRA issue a final counteraction notice.

 The WRA, where it has issued a proposed counteraction notice, must issue a final counteraction notice stating whether the tax advantage arising from the tax avoidance arrangement is to be counteracted by either a closure notice or a WRA assessment. This means that even where the WRA accepts the taxpayer’s return is not subject to the GAAR (perhaps because of the written representations) the WRA must issue a final counteraction notice confirming that action under the GAAR is not to be pursued. 
 If the WRA does consider that the tax advantage should be counteracted by the GAAR then the final counteraction notice must also: 
 
 specify the adjustment required to give effect to the counteraction, 
 set out the amendment necessary, where the adjustment relates to a return that is under enquiry, to be included in the closure notice, 
 where the tax advantage is not to be counteracted through a closure notice, an assessment must be made at the same time as issuing the notice, or an assessment already made must be identified as giving effect to the counteraction, and 
 specify the amount of tax that must be paid as a result of the amendment required or assessment

This is because the notices themselves do not create a tax liability. The closure notice or the assessment issued to give effect to the counteraction notice are reviewable and appealable decisions.

 In Inland Revenue Commissions v Brebner ([1967] 2 W.L.R. 1001), the Court of Appeal considered whether a tax advantage was “one of the main objects” of entering into an arrangement:
	 
 “… when the question of carrying out a genuine commercial transaction, as this was, is reviewed, the fact that there are two ways of carrying it out - one by paying the maximum amount of tax, the other by paying no, or much less, tax - it would be quite wrong, as a necessary consequence, to draw the inference that, in adopting the latter course, one of the main objects is, for the purposes of the section, avoidance of tax. No commercial man in his senses is going to carry out a commercial transaction except upon the footing of paying the smallest amount of tax that he can. The question whether in fact one of the main objects was to avoid tax is one for the Special Commissioners to decide upon a consideration of all the relevant evidence before them and the proper inferences to be drawn from that evidence.” [at p 718-9] 
 
 
 In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Trustees of the Sema Group Pension Scheme ([2002] EWHC 94 (Ch). The extract was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in [2002] EWCA Civ. 1857 at paragraph 119.), the High Court was asked to consider whether “one of the main objects” of entering into an arrangement was to obtain a tax advantage:
	 
 “The tax advantage may not be a relevant factor in the decision to purchase or sell or in the decision to purchase or sell at a particular price. Obviously if the tax advantage is mere “icing on the cake” it will not constitute a main object. Nor will it necessarily do so merely because it is a feature of the transaction or a relevant factor in the decision to buy or sell. The statutory criterion is that the tax advantage shall be more than relevant or indeed an object; it must be a main object.” [at para. 53] 
 
 
 More recently, in Versteegh Ltd and others v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2013] UKFTT 642 (TC)) the First-tier Tribunal whether a tax advantage was a “main purpose or one of the main purposes” of the taxpayer entering into the arrangement:
	 
 “In the same way that the mere presence of a commercial purpose cannot rule out the existence of tax avoidance as being a main purposes, the mere existence of a tax advantage, known to the taxpayer, does not on its own render the obtaining of that advantage a main purpose. All the authorities point to the question being one of degree and significance to the taxpayer, and that the question is one of fact for the tribunal, having regard to all the circumstances.” [at para. 158] 
 
 
 In UBS AG v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2016] UKSC 13), the Supreme Court considered whether to interpret provisions in income tax legislation to lead to tax-free bonuses awarded by various banks in 2004 in such a way to enable them to be regarded as a means of avoiding income tax:
	 
 “There is nothing in the background to suggest that Parliament intended that [the provisions allowing for the award of tax-free bonuses] should also apply to transactions having no connection to the real world of business, where a restrictive condition was deliberately contrived with no business or commercial purpose but solely in order to take advantage of the exemption.” [para 78]

629,629,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3010 Introduction," It is important that the collection and management of Welsh devolved taxes operates fairly and efficiently. The WRA recognises that most taxpayers want to comply with their obligations. 
 The WRA has various powers to help check that taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities and pay the right amount of tax at the right time, to ensure that the taxes are operating as intended and to detect and to deter the minority who do not comply with their obligations. 
 To encourage compliance and deter non-compliance a range of fixed amount, daily and tax-geared civil penalties apply to the devolved taxes. The WRA has the power in certain circumstances, and for certain penalties, to suspend or waive a penalty. 
 This section provides guidance on the civil penalties regime which applies to the devolved taxes and which is contained in TCMA (and mainly Part 5 of that Act), including the assessment and enforcement rules underpinning each penalty. 
 Taxpayers have the right to request a review or appeal to the Tribunal in relation to any penalty issued by WRA. 
 Taxpayers are not liable to any penalty described in this guidance if they have already been convicted of a criminal offence arising out of the same conduct. This is known as the ‘double jeopardy’ rule. 
 The guidance in this section is structured as follows: 
 
 Penalties and the Human Rights Act 1998 
 Penalties for failure to make a tax return 
 Penalties for failure to pay tax 
 Penalties for failure to notify under-assessment/under-determination 
 Penalties relating to record-keeping 
 Penalties relating to investigations 
 Penalties relating to inaccuracies, reasonable care and suspension 
 Determining and calculating the penalty amount 
 Reasonable excuse 
 Reduction for disclosure 
 Special circumstances 
 Appeals and reviews of penalty decisions 
 More than one penalty chargeable

630,630,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3020 Penalties and the Human Rights Act 1998," Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) is incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 6 provides a person with various rights and safeguards when WRA is deciding whether to impose certain penalties. 
 The ECHR and case-law defines certain penalties as “criminal” penalties, such as penalties imposed because of deliberate behaviour. Such penalties are not criminal under UK law (i.e. they are civil penalties), although they are regarded as “criminal” for the purposes of the ECHR. 
 Because these types of penalties are regarded as criminal by the ECHR, taxpayers are afforded rights by Article 6. These include: 
 
 the right for a person to be informed promptly of the nature of, and reason for, any charge against them 
 an entitlement to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time, and 
 the right not to self-incriminate 
 
 If WRA believes that a penalty that might be due is likely to engage Article 6, the person who may be liable to the penalty will be notified of this fact.

631,631,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3030 Penalties for failure to make a tax return," A taxpayer required to make a tax return is liable to a £100 penalty if they fail to make a tax return on or before the filing date. 
 For LTT, the filing date is 30 days from the effective date of the transaction. This is usually the completion date. 
 For LDT, the filing date is the last working day of the month following the month in which the accounting period ends (see LDTA/5010 and LDTA/5020 for more information). 
 If the failure to make a tax return continues, the taxpayer is liable to further penalties, as follows: 
 
 
 
 Failure to make a tax return 
 Penalty 
 
 
 
 
 1 day late 
 £100 
 
 
 6 months late 
 Extra £300 or 5% of any unpaid tax, whichever is greater 
 
 
 12 months late 
 Another £300; or 5% of any unpaid tax, whichever is greater 
 
 
 
 However, if the taxpayer withholds information that would enable or assist the WRA to assess their liability to a devolved tax, the penalty amount is the greater of: 
 
 £300, or 
 an amount not exceeding 95% of the amount of the devolved tax to which the person would have been liable if the tax return had been made 
 
 Any penalties in this section must be paid within a period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the notice of the penalty is issued, unless the taxpayer requests a review or appeals to the tribunal. 
 The WRA may reduce a penalty for failure to make a tax return if the taxpayer discloses information which has been withheld as a result of that failure. 
 LDT-specific penalties for multiple failures to make tax returns 
 Where a taxpayer becomes liable to a penalty for failure to make a return for landfill disposals tax (LDT), further failures to make returns within a defined penalty period will attract a higher penalty rate. 
 The penalty period begins with the day after the filing date for the tax return, and ends 12 months later. The penalty period may be extended on the same basis where there are further failures to make tax returns. 
 The penalties are as follows: 
 
 
 
 Initial failure within the penalty period 
 £200 
 
 
 Second failure within the penalty period 
 £300 
 
 
 Third and subsequent failures within the penalty period 
 £400 each time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Company A is required to make a return for the period 1 April 2018 to 30 to June 2018 on or before the filing date of 31 July 2018, but fails to do so. The WRA imposes a penalty of £100 for failure to make a return. The penalty period runs from 1 August 2018 to 31 July 2019. 
 If Company A then fails to make a return for the period 1 October 2018 to 31 December 2018, this failure falls within the penalty period. The company is liable to a penalty of £200 and the penalty period is extended to 31 January 2020. A third failure within the penalty period will give rise to a £300 penalty and the fourth and subsequent failures to penalties of £400.

 Penalty for failure to repay a tax credit on time 
 The WRA may impose a penalty where the WRA issues a taxpayer with an assessment to recover an amount of tax credit that ought not to have been paid (or set off against a tax liability), or that has become excessive, and the amount assessed is not paid by the taxpayer on time. The penalty is 5% of the amount payable as a result of the WRA assessment.

 The penalty amount will not exceed 30% of the potential lost revenue. 
 In deciding what steps (if any) were reasonable, the WRA must consider whether the taxpayer knew, or should have known, about the under-determination or under-assessment. 
 Assessing and paying the penalty 
 The WRA must make an assessment and notify the taxpayer of their liability to this penalty (stating the period against which the penalty has been assessed) within the period of 12 months beginning with: 
 
 the end of the ‘appeal period’ (see below) for a decision which corrects the inaccuracy or understatement (such as a decision to make a WRA assessment), or 
 if there is no such assessment by the WRA to the tax concerned above, the date on which the inaccuracy or understatement is corrected 
 
 The ‘appeal period’ is the period during which an appeal against a WRA decision could be brought, or the period during which an appeal that has been brought has not been finally determined or withdrawn. 
 Subject to the above time limit, the WRA can make a supplementary assessment of the taxpayer’s liability to this penalty if an earlier assessment made by the WRA was calculated using an underestimate of the potential lost revenue.

635,635,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3070 Penalties relating to investigations," A taxpayer is liable to a fixed penalty of £300 if they: 
 
 fail to comply with an information notice, or 
 deliberately obstruct the WRA (or a person authorised by the WRA) in the course of an inspection or in the exercise of a power that has been approved by the tribunal under section 108 TCMA 
 
 If the failure or obstruction continues after the date on which this first fixed penalty of £300 is imposed, the taxpayer is liable to a further penalty (or penalties) of up to £60 for each subsequent day on which the failure or obstruction continues. 
 This daily penalty amount may be increased if, in relation to an unidentified third party notice, the failure or obstruction continues over a longer period of time. WRA may only impose an increased daily default penalty in relation to this type of information notice where: 
 
 the failure continues for more than 30 days from the date of the penalty notice 
 the notice recipient has been told that an application is going to be made for an increased penalty, and 
 the tribunal, on application by WRA, determines that a penalty may be imposed. 
 
 The tribunal has to take into consideration various factors, such as the cost to the notice recipient of complying with the request. The tribunal cannot set a penalty amount exceeding £1000 per applicable day. 
 Alternatively, in addition to the fixed £300 and ‘up to’ £60 daily penalties, the taxpayer may be liable to an additional penalty amount. This amount would be determined by the Upper Tribunal. 
 The additional penalty would be incurred where the WRA has reason to believe that, as a result of continued failure or obstruction, the amount of tax that the taxpayer has paid (or is likely to pay), or the amount that the person has paid (or is likely to pay) in respect of a tax credit, is significantly less than it would otherwise have been for that failure or obstruction. 
 In determining the amount of the penalty, the Upper Tribunal must have regard to the amount of unpaid tax, or amount unpaid in respect of a tax credit. The penalty must be imposed within 12 months of the later of: 
 
 the date of the initial £300 penalty notice 
 the end of the period in which an appeal against the information notice could have been made (but was not), or 
 the date on which an appeal against the information notice is determined or withdrawn 
 
 The taxpayer is not liable to either the £300 fixed penalty or the ‘up to’ £60 daily penalty if: 
 
 they satisfy the WRA or (on appeal) the tribunal that there is a reasonable excuse for either their failure to comply or obstruction, or 
 they fail to do something they are required to do within a limited period of time (such as a requirement in an information notice to produce documents by a specified time), but they did it within such further time as the WRA may have allowed 
 
 The WRA must make an assessment and notify the taxpayer of their liability to either penalty (the £300 fixed penalty and the ‘up to’ £60 daily penalty) within 12 months of the date on which they first became liable to the penalty. 
 The taxpayer must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the WRA issued the notice of the penalty assessment, unless: 
 
 the taxpayer gives a notice of review against the penalty, in which case they must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the review is concluded and the decision to award a penalty is upheld, or 
 the taxpayer gives a notice of appeal against the penalty, in which case they must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the appeal is finally determined and the award of the penalty is upheld or the appeal is withdrawn 
 
 The WRA will charge interest on the amount of any unpaid penalty from the date following the date on which the penalty is due to be paid until it is paid.

636,636,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,"TCMA/3080 Penalties relating to inaccuracies, reasonable care and penalty suspension"," A person is liable to a penalty where, owing to a lack of reasonable care (careless behaviour) or deliberate behaviour, they give the WRA a document which contains an inaccuracy that leads to: 
 
 an understatement of a liability to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated statement of a loss relating to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated claim to repayment of devolved tax, or 
 a false or inflated claim for a tax credit 
 
 An inaccuracy is careless if it is due to the taxpayer failing to take reasonable care. In other words, if reasonable care was taken, an inaccuracy would be neither deliberate nor careless. 
 The amount of the penalty imposed depends on the behaviour exhibited by the taxpayer. Penalties are then calculated as a percentage of the potential lost revenue. TCMA allows the WRA to impose penalties not exceeding a certain amount. 
 The WRA will apply penalty ranges as summarised in the table below: 
 
 
 
 
 Type of behaviour 
 
 
 Unprompted disclosure 
 
 
 Prompted disclosure 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reasonable care taken

 15% to 30% 
 
 
 
 
 Deliberate 
 
 
 30% to 100% 
 
 
 50% to 100% 
 
 
 
 
 An inaccuracy which was neither deliberate nor careless on the part of the taxpayer when the document containing the inaccuracy was given to the WRA, is to be treated as being careless if the taxpayer discovered the inaccuracy at a later time and did not take reasonable steps to inform the WRA as soon as was practicable after the inaccuracy was discovered. 
 Reasonable care 
 ‘Reasonable care’ can simply be defined as the behaviour of a prudent and reasonable person in the position of the person in question. 
 This was suggested by Judge Berner in the First-Tier Tribunal decision in HMRC v David Collis, where it was noted: 
 
 That penalty applies if the inaccuracy in the relevant document is due to a failure on the part of the taxpayer (or other person giving the document) to take reasonable care. We consider that the standard by which this falls to be judged is that of a prudent and reasonable taxpayer in the position of the taxpayer in question. 
 
 The WRA recognises that people do make mistakes. In determining whether or not a person has failed to take reasonable care, the WRA will seek to establish whether the person has taken the care and attention that could be expected from a reasonable person taking reasonable care in similar circumstances. 
 For reasonable care to apply there must be no question, for example, about whether or not the person knew about an inaccuracy when they provided the information or document to the WRA or failed to comply with the relevant requirement. If the person did know about the inaccuracy when they provided the information to the WRA or failed to comply with the relevant requirement, that would be a deliberate inaccuracy or deliberate failure for the purposes of determining the penalty. 
 In determining whether or not the person failed to take reasonable care, the WRA will examine what the person did (or did not do), and will consider whether a prudent and reasonable person would have done (or not done) that in those circumstances. Although the WRA expects every person to take reasonable care, the WRA cannot determine whether or not they have done so without considering the person’s abilities and circumstances. 
 For example, the WRA would not ordinarily expect the same level of knowledge or expertise from a self-employed, un-represented individual as from a large multinational company. Large or complex issues would also require a greater level of care to arrive at the correct tax position. Importantly then, the WRA expects taxpayers to take appropriate professional advice where necessary – failure to do so where the transaction clearly required it would be a failure to take reasonable care. 
 Repeated inaccuracies or failures to comply may, for example, form part of a pattern of behaviour which suggests a lack of care by the person in developing adequate systems for the recording of transactions or preparing tax returns. If the person becomes aware of the causes of an inaccuracy or failure but after this nevertheless repeats the inaccuracy or failure, this may indicate deliberate behaviour on the part of the person in relation to those repetitions. 
 Examples of when a penalty might not be due (because a person did take reasonable care) include: 
 
 a reasonably arguable view that is subsequently not upheld 
 an arithmetical or transposition inaccuracy that is not so large either in absolute terms or relative to a person’s overall tax liability, as to produce an obviously odd result or be picked up by a “sense” check 
 a person taking action which leads to the inaccuracy or failure following advice from the WRA that later proves to be wrong, provided that all the details and circumstances were given by the person to the WRA when the advice was sought 
 a person acting on advice from a competent adviser which proves to be wrong despite the adviser being given a full set of the accurate facts, and 
 a person accepting and using information from another person whose competence the taxpayer could reasonably expect to rely on but where it is not possible to check that the information is accurate and complete 
 
 Suspending the penalty 
 The WRA may, subject to one or more conditions, suspend all or part of the penalty for a  careless  inaccuracy. 
 A careless inaccuracy penalty may only be suspended if compliance with a condition of the suspension will help a person avoid becoming liable to any further penalties.  
 A penalty for a deliberate inaccuracy cannot be suspended. 
 If the WRA decides that a suspension is justifiable, a notice must be issued to the taxpayer specifying: 
 
 what part of the penalty is to be suspended 
 the period of suspension (which cannot exceed 2 years), and 
 the condition(s) of suspension which the taxpayer must comply with. 
 
 A condition of suspension may specify an action to be taken, and the period within which that action may be taken. WRA will set SMART conditions when suspending a penalty.  SMART  conditions are: 
 
 Specific  – directly related to the business or individual. 
 Measurable  – the taxpayer will need to be able to ‘evidence’ that the condition has been met at end of the suspension period. 
 Achievable  – it must be in the taxpayer’s power to meet the condition. 
 Realistic  – Conditions cannot be unreasonable (for example, it would not be reasonable to require a small one-man business to employ a full-time bookkeeper, conditions must be economically realistic). 
 Time bound  – there must be a clear date by which the condition(s) must be met. 
 
 On the expiry of the period of suspension, the suspended penalty (or part of the penalty that was suspended) is cancelled if the taxpayer satisfies the WRA that they have complied with the suspension conditions. 
 If the WRA is not satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with the suspension conditions, the suspended penalty (or part of the penalty that was suspended) becomes payable. This will include any interest on the penalty that would have otherwise been chargeable but for the suspension. 
 If, during the period of suspension, you become liable to another penalty for providing a document to the WRA containing a careless or a deliberate inaccuracy, the suspended penalty (or the part of the penalty that was suspended) becomes payable, together with any interest on the penalty that would have otherwise been chargeable but for the suspension.

637,637,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3090 Determining and calculating the penalty amount," Penalties fall into 2 broad categories: those set at a fixed amount, and those where the amount may vary (usually up to a certain limit). 
 The WRA will calculate the penalty amount, normally by applying the penalty at the upper limit of each penalty range and then determining whether a reduction may be available in view of the particular circumstances and facts of the case. 
 The WRA may reduce the amount of the penalty: 
 
 because of special circumstances, or 
 if the taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA 
 
 Calculating the potential lost revenue 
 Normal rule 
 The normal rule for potential lost revenue (‘PLR’) is that it is the additional amount payable to the WRA as a result of: 
 
 correcting an inaccuracy in a document, including an inaccuracy attributable to another person 
 failing to tell the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment 
 an inaccurate repayment or credit having been made by the WRA as a result of the inaccuracy, or 
 a repayment or credit that would have been incorrectly made by the WRA if the inaccuracy had not been corrected 
 
 When determining the PLR for the purposes of calculating the amount of a penalty, the PLR itself may be subject to recovery or retention by a procedure such as a WRA assessment or the WRA formally refusing a claim. 
 An inaccuracy can affect the tax due in more than one tax period. The additional amount of tax due as a result of putting right an inaccuracy includes any tax effect from that inaccuracy that arises in later or earlier tax periods. 
 Inaccuracies in other documents that have been given to the WRA for the same transaction or period will be considered separately in terms of calculating penalty amounts. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 
 
 
   
 John purchases a house and submits an LTT return for the transaction, the result of which is that John pays £5,000 in LTT. Following a compliance check it was agreed that John had made a careless inaccuracy in completing the LTT return. As a result of correcting the inaccuracy, John’s LTT liability is now £8,000. 
 The PLR is £3,000 (£8,000 – £5,000).

As a result of correcting the inaccuracy, Sarah’s claim is reduced to £1,400.

 Potential lost revenue: multiple errors 
 If the taxpayer is liable to more than one penalty under section 129 TCMA in respect of more than one inaccuracy in the same document, the order in which the inaccuracies are corrected may affect the amount of PLR. Where this is the case, careless inaccuracies are to be taken to be corrected before deliberate inaccuracies. 
 If the taxpayer is liable to a penalty under section 129 TCMA in respect of one or more understatements in one or more documents relating to a tax period or transaction, in calculating the PLR the WRA will take account of any overstatement in any document the taxpayer has given us in relation to the same tax period or transaction. 
 Where this is the case, overstatements are to be set against understatements in the following order: 
 
 understatements in relation to which the taxpayer is not liable to a penalty 
 careless understatements, and 
 deliberate understatements 
 
 ‘Understatement’ in this case means an inaccuracy that amounts to, or leads to: 
 
 an understatement of a liability to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated statement of a loss relating to a devolved tax, or 
 a false or inflated claim to repayment of devolved tax 
 
 ‘Overstatement’ in this case means an inaccuracy which is not an understatement. In other words, it is an inaccuracy which does not amount to, or lead to, any of the above results. 
 If the overall effect of the overstatements and understatements is that the tax liability is overstated when the document was submitted, there will be no PLR. 
 In calculating PLR for the purposes of a penalty under section 129 TCMA, no account is to be taken of the fact that a PLR from the taxpayer (the person who gave the WRA the document containing the inaccuracy) is or may be balanced by a potential overpayment by another person (except to the extent that legislation requires or permits another person’s tax liability to be adjusted by reference to the taxpayer’s tax liability). 
 Inaccuracies in other documents that have been given to the WRA for the same transaction or period will be considered separately in terms of calculating penalty amounts. 
 Potential lost revenue: losses 
 
 Where an inaccuracy has the result that a loss is wrongly recorded for the purposes of a devolved tax, and the loss has been wholly used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer, the PLR is calculated in accordance with the ‘normal rule’ (see the first sub-heading in this section, ‘Potential lost revenue: Normal rule’). 
 Where an inaccuracy has the result that a loss is wrongly recorded for the purposes of a devolved tax, and either all or part of the wrongly recorded loss has not yet been used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer (and so the tax effect is not yet known), the PLR is:
	 
 calculated in accordance with the ‘normal rule’ (see the first sub=heading in this section, ‘Potential lost revenue: Normal rule’) in respect of any part of the loss (if any) that has been used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer, plus 
 a discounted rate of 10% (the discounted rate) of the unused loss. The discounted rate recognises uncertainty about the current tax value of the loss when it is eventually used to reduce the taxpayer’s tax liability. 
 
 
 
 Both of the above rules 1 and 2 (a loss being wholly or not wholly used to reduce the amount of tax due and payable) apply both to: 
 
 a case where no loss would have been recorded but for the inaccuracy, and 
 to a case where a loss of a different amount would have been recorded – in this case, both of the above rules apply only to the difference between the amount recorded and the true amount. 
 
 Finally, the PLR in respect of a loss in any case is nil where, because of either the nature of the loss or the taxpayer’s circumstances, there is no reasonable prospect of the loss being used in the future to support a claim to reduce the tax liability of any person. 
 Whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of any such loss being used depends on the nature of the loss and the taxpayer’s circumstances. In determining whether or not there is a reasonable prospect, the WRA will consider if there is a legal or factual reason which means that the loss can never be used. If the answer to this is ‘yes’, then the PLR for that loss is nil. 
 Potential lost revenue: delayed tax 
 Where an inaccuracy (a ‘delayed tax inaccuracy’) results in an amount of tax (‘the delayed tax’) being declared to the WRA later than it should have been, the PLR is: 
 
 5% of the delayed tax for each year of the delay, or 
 a percentage of the delayed tax, for each separate period of delay of less than a year, equating to 5% per year 
 
 This rule (the ‘delayed tax rule’) applies instead of the normal rules for calculating the PLR, but it does not apply to a case which falls under the ‘Potential lost revenue: losses’ heading above (i.e. a wrongly recorded loss). 
 The delayed tax rule covers cases where the delayed tax inaccuracy only has a timing effect so that, comparing an earlier period with a later one, there is no overall loss of tax (assuming the same rate of tax applies to both periods). The rule also covers situations where an over-claim in one period is matched by an under-claim in a later period. 
 In other words, for the delayed tax rule to apply a delayed tax inaccuracy always has two elements in different tax periods (one understatement and one overstatement) - even if a return for one period (that would contain the overstatement) is not yet due to be filed. Both elements of the delayed tax inaccuracy fall under the delayed tax rule, so the multiple inaccuracy rules (see the previous heading) do not apply to either the understatement or overstatement element of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 If the later return has not yet been filed, the WRA needs to decide whether the reversal would have taken place without the taxpayer doing anything if the inaccuracy had not been discovered. If the WRA is satisfied that it would have been automatically corrected (for example by the taxpayer’s accounting system) then the delayed tax rule applies. 
 
 
 
 
 Example - understatement in one return followed by overstatement in later return  
 
 
   
 Company A had an accounting system problem which resulted in a landfill invoice dated 10 June 2018 being incorrectly allocated to its second quarterly return (covering the 01/07/18 to 30/09/18 period) rather than the return covering the first quarterly period (01/04/18 to 30/06/18) period. As a result of the accounting problem, £10,000 of LDT was omitted from the first quarterly return and included instead on the second quarterly return without Company A taking any remedial action. 
 During a compliance check in November 2018, the WRA discovers the £10,000 omitted from the first quarterly return and included in the 2nd quarterly return. Company A accepts that it had failed to take reasonable care by not maintaining an adequate accounting system. 
 LDT of £10,000 has been declared later than it should have been. The inaccuracy was reversed in a later return without Company A having to do anything. The WRA is satisfied that the inaccuracy has both an understatement and an overstatement and is therefore a delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is therefore calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £10,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example - claim made prematurely  
 
 
   
 Company B, a landfill site operator, claimed £3,000 credit for LDT in its tax return for the quarterly return period 01/07/19 to 30/09/19, when it should have claimed it in its return for the following quarterly period 01/10/19 to 31/12/19. 
 During compliance checks in November 2019, the WRA discover this careless inaccuracy in Company B’s quarterly return. At this point the following quarterly return is not yet due. 
 In the WRA’s view, Company B’s accounting systems would not have claimed the amount of credit again in the following quarterly return, so the PLR for the penalty is calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £3,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £37.50

 The PLR is therefore calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £10,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £125 
 
 Example - claim made prematurely  
 
 
   
 Company B, a landfill site operator, claimed £3,000 credit for LDT in its tax return for the quarterly return period 01/07/19 to 30/09/19, when it should have claimed it in its return for the following quarterly period 01/10/19 to 31/12/19. 
 During compliance checks in November 2019, the WRA discover this careless inaccuracy in Company B’s quarterly return. At this point the following quarterly return is not yet due. 
 In the WRA’s view, Company B’s accounting systems would not have claimed the amount of credit again in the following quarterly return, so the PLR for the penalty is calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £3,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £37.50

638,638,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3100 Reasonable excuse," The taxpayer can appeal against some penalties if they have a reasonable excuse, for example for their return or payment being late. 
 A reasonable excuse is something that stopped the taxpayer meeting a tax obligation that they took reasonable care to meet. 
 There is no statutory definition of a reasonable excuse: it is a matter to be considered in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. What is reasonable will differ from person to person depending on their particular circumstances and abilities. 
 The following categories are examples of things which the WRA may consider to be a reasonable excuse for a period of time, but as mentioned before it will ultimately depend on the individual circumstances of each case, which are likely to require many other factors to be taken into account: 
 
 bereavement – the death of a close relative or domestic partner around the time of the failure or obstruction 
 serious illness – if this affects the taxpayer or a close relative or domestic partner around the time of the failure or obstruction 
 an unexpected stay in hospital that prevented the taxpayer from dealing with their tax affairs 
 a loss of records through fire, flood or theft 
 an unexpected loss of key personnel 
 computer or software failure just before or while the taxpayer was preparing their online return 
 unexpected disruption to the WRA’s online services 
 postal delays that the taxpayer couldn’t have predicted 
 delays related to a taxpayer’s disability 
 
 The following won’t be accepted as a reasonable excuse: 
 
 reliance on another person (unless the taxpayer took reasonable care to avoid the failure or obstruction) 
 a shortage of funds meaning the taxpayer is unable to pay what is due 
 the taxpayer made a mistake on their tax return 
 
 While a shortage of funds may not, on its own, be considered a reasonable excuse, the reason for the shortage of funds may be considered by WRA, where it was attributable to events outside the taxpayer’s control. In these circumstances, the WRA will consider whether the shortage of funds could have reasonably been avoided. 
 In addition, the WRA would not generally consider the following to be a reasonable excuse: 
 
 the tax return is too difficult to complete 
 pressure of work 
 lack of information 
 the fact that the WRA did not remind the taxpayer about something 
 ignorance of the law, or 
 a combination of any of the above 
 
 The onus is on the taxpayer to satisfy the WRA that they had a reasonable excuse at the time of the failure or obstruction (whichever applies). It is important to appreciate that a reasonable excuse does not apply where the failure or obstruction was deliberate. 
 The taxpayer must comply with their obligations as soon as possible after their reasonable excuse is resolved. If they do not put right the action or inaction without unreasonable delay after the excuse has ended, they remain liable to the penalty. 
 The WRA will consider carefully both the point at which a reasonable excuse ends and the actions the taxpayer took after that time to put right the action/inaction, or otherwise remedy the failure. Each case must be dealt with on its own merits. 
 In terms of unreasonable delay, there is no statutory definition of ‘unreasonable’. Again, each case must be judged on its own merits in view of the taxpayer’s abilities and circumstances. 
 If the WRA decides not to accept the taxpayer’s excuse as reasonable and impose a penalty, they can request a review or appeal in relation to the WRA’s decision.

639,639,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3110 Special circumstances," The WRA may reduce the amount of any of the following penalties (including any interest in relation to the penalty) if it thinks it is right to do so because of special circumstances: 
 
 any penalty for failing to make a tax return 
 any penalty for failing to pay tax 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to WRA 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to WRA and which is attributable to a person other than the taxpayer 
 a penalty for failing to notify the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment of tax 
 
 The WRA may also decide, because of special circumstances, to apply any of the following actions in relation to these penalties (including any interest in relation to the penalty): 
 
 remitting the penalty entirely 
 suspend it, and 
 agreeing a compromise with the taxpayer in relation to proceedings for the penalty 
 
 Special circumstances do not include taxpayer’s ability to pay, on its own, or the fact that a potential loss of revenue to the WRA by the taxpayer is balanced by a potential over-payment to the WRA by someone else. 
 To be considered as special circumstances, the circumstances in question must apply to the taxpayer and must not be general circumstances that apply to many taxpayers by virtue of the penalty legislation. 
 Special circumstances are something that is not otherwise provided for in legislation. So, for example, they will not include: 
 
 matters that amount to a reasonable excuse or reasonable care, or 
 the usual factors - telling, helping and giving access - which the WRA takes into account when considering whether or not to reduce the amount of a penalty for quality of disclosure 
 
 Special circumstances are uncommon or exceptional circumstances that should be clearly recognisable as such and are completely separate from the other considerations mentioned above. 
 Special circumstances may include the fact that the WRA has agreed that a person may pay an amount of devolved tax in instalments over an agreed period, but this may not be decisive; WRA will weigh up the circumstances of each particular case and consider all relevant factors.

640,640,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3120 Reduction for disclosure," Qualifying disclosures 
 The WRA may reduce the amount of the following penalties if the taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA: 
 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to the WRA 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to the WRA and which is attributable to another person 
 a penalty for failing to notify the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment of tax 
 
 A qualifying disclosure in relation to a penalty for an inaccuracy must go beyond the mere submission of a return. 
 A ‘qualifying disclosure’ (under section 139(2) TCMA) means disclosure of: 
 
 an inaccuracy 
 a supply of false information or withholding of information, or 
 a failure to disclose an under-assessment or under-determination 
 
 The taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA (under section 139(3) TCMA) by: 
 
 telling the WRA about it 
 giving the WRA reasonable help in quantifying the inaccuracy, the inaccuracy attributable to the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination, and 
 allowing the WRA to access the taxpayer’s records so the WRA can ensure that the inaccuracy, the inaccuracy attributable to the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination is fully corrected 
 
 Any reductions for a qualifying disclosure may reflect (under section 139(4) TCMA): 
 
 whether the disclosure of the relevant information was prompted or unprompted, and 
 the quality of the disclosure 
 
 Disclosure of relevant information is ‘unprompted’ if the taxpayer made it at a time when the taxpayer had no reason to believe that the WRA had discovered, or was about to discover, the inaccuracy, the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination. 
 Disclosure of relevant information which is not unprompted is otherwise ‘prompted’ (under section 139(5) TCMA). 
 In relation to disclosure, ‘quality’ includes the timing, nature and extent of the disclosure (section 139(6) TCMA). 
 The ‘Reductions’ heading further below sets out the different levels of reduction the WRA may make to a penalty amount, depending on the quality of the disclosure and whether it was prompted or unprompted. 
 Reductions 
 As mentioned above, the WRA may at its discretion reduce the amount of a penalty depending on the quality of the taxpayer’s disclosure and whether it was prompted or unprompted. The amount by which the WRA may reduce the penalty will vary on a case by case basis.  
 The quality of disclosure revolves around the 3 core elements: ‘telling, helping and giving access’. These determine where the penalty will fall within the penalty range.  
 For: 
 
 telling, the WRA may give up to 30% 
 helping, the WRA may give up to 40% 
 giving access to records, the WRA may give up to 30% 
 
 This adds up to 100% of the total possible reduction. 
 Examples 
 
 Telling the WRA about, or agreeing that there is something wrong and how and why it happened. 
 Telling the WRA about the extent of what is wrong as soon as the taxpayer knows about it. 
 Telling and helping the WRA by answering questions in full. 
 Helping the WRA to understand documents or information. 
 Helping the WRA by replying to letters quickly. 
 Helping the WRA by agreeing to attend any meetings, or visits at a mutually convenient time. 
 Helping the WRA by checking records to identify the extent of the inaccuracy. 
 Helping the WRA by using the taxpayer’s private records to identify sales or income not included in their tax return. 
 Giving access to documents the WRA has asked for without unnecessary delay. 
 Giving access to documents the WRA may not know about, as well as those that it asks to see. 
 
 There may be overlaps among the categories above. A single course of action may qualify for a reduction under more than one category. 
 
 
 
 
 Example - calculating the penalty percentage rate 
 
 
   
 The penalty percentage rate is determined by the penalty range and the reduction for the quality of disclosure. 
 For example, if the WRA found a careless inaccuracy in a tax return that the taxpayer did not tell it about before an enquiry began. When the WRA told the taxpayer about the inaccuracy, they agreed with the WRA. This was a prompted disclosure.  
 The penalty range for a careless inaccuracy with a prompted disclosure is 15% to 30% of the potential lost revenue. 
 The reduction for quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving) was 70%. 
 
 
 
 Circumstances 
 Calculation 
 
 
 
 
 To work out the penalty percentage rate, the WRA first calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum penalty percentages 
 30% minus 15% = 15% 
 
 
 The WRA then multiplies that figure by the reduction for quality of disclosure to arrive at the percentage reduction 
 15% x 70% = 10.5% 
 
 
 The WRA then deducts the percentage reduction from the maximum penalty percentage it can charge 
 30% minus 10.5% = 19.5% 
 
 
 This gives the penalty percentage rate 
 19.5%

642,642,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3140 More than one penalty chargeable," In some circumstances, more than one penalty may be due to the WRA where a taxpayer has failed to comply with the obligations of the devolved tax legislation. In such circumstances, the WRA will determine whether each penalty is applicable on its own merits according to the facts. However, in determining the penalty amount where the amount is not fixed, the WRA will also consider the aggregate result of the combined penalties to ensure they are proportionate to the taxpayer’s circumstances, behaviour, and the amount of tax understated (or lost via an inflated statement of losses, claim for repayment or tax credit). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Company A has agreed an alternative weighing method with the WRA to calculate the weight of waste disposed of at its authorised landfill site. However, the company does not apply the alternative method in line with the agreement. This also leads to an incorrect tax return being filed for the period in question, as the wrong weight was used in calculating taxable disposals. The WRA becomes aware of the issue when it carries out an enquiry into the tax return for the quarter when the incorrect method was used. The inaccuracy arose from a failure to take reasonable care. 
 As a result, the company is liable both to a penalty not exceeding £500 under section 61 of the Landfill Disposals Tax Act 2017 (for failure to determine taxable weight properly), and to a penalty not exceeding 30% of the potential lost revenue under section 129 TCMA (for a careless inaccuracy in a return). 
 In cases such as this, in addition to considering whether penalties may be reduced on their own terms, WRA will also consider the effect of the combined penalties to ensure the overall result is proportionate to the circumstances and amount of devolved tax understated.

643,643,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2010 Claiming a refund," There are 3 circumstances under which a claim for a tax refund may be made: 
 
 If you believe that you have been assessed for tax more than once for the same transaction (under section 62 TCMA) 
 If you believe that you have paid an amount of tax that was not chargeable, or if a WRA assessment or determination has been made that you are chargeable to an amount of tax and you disagree (section 63 TCMA) 
 Where you have paid an amount of tax according to a set of rates and bands, but those rates and bands are subsequently rejected by the National Assembly for Wales (section 63A TCMA) 
 
 We have developed specific  online forms for different refund claims(https://www.gov.wales/claim-land-transaction-tax-refund) . 
 Where you have paid higher rates on your residential LTT transaction but have subsequently sold your previous main residence and wish to make a claim for the higher rates portion of the tax in accordance with the rules, this will be treated as an amendment under section 41 TCMA if it is made within 12 months of the date of the return. Outside of the 12 months, this will be treated as a claim under section 63 TCMA. We have a specific form for higher rates refunds, which can be found by following the link above.

644,644,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2020 Making a claim," As outlined in TCMA/2010(/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-relief-case-excessive-assessment-or-overpaid-tax#6493), we have specific  online forms for different types of refund claims(https://www.gov.wales/claim-land-transaction-tax-refund)  which should be used wherever possible. 
 When making a repayment claim, the claimant must: 
 
 make the claim within 4 years beginning with the day after the filing date for the tax return to which the payment by way of devolved tax, or the assessment or determination, relates 
 provide a declaration that all the particulars given in the claim are correctly stated to the best of their information and belief, and 
 keep and preserve certain records which may be needed to make a correct and complete claim. The claimant may be liable to a penalty if they fail to keep and preserve these records as required 
 
 The online claim form should include the following information: 
 
 confirmation of which of the three circumstances outlined in  TCMA/2010(/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-relief-case-excessive-assessment-or-overpaid-tax#6493) 
 a statement of the amount of devolved tax which will need to be discharged or repaid to give effect to the claim 
 the grounds on which the claimant believes the double assessment or overpayment of tax has occurred, including details of any previous charge, and  
 supporting statements, documents and any other information which the WRA might reasonably require to determine whether and, if so, the extent to which the claim is correct 
 
 The WRA will only accept a claim if the relevant information and documentary evidence is provided by or on behalf of the claimant. 
 A claim should not be made by including it in a tax return. 
 Requests for refunds outside of the time limits to amend the return will generally be treated by WRA as a potential claim under section 62, 63 or 63A TCMA.  
 Giving effect to a claim 
 As soon as practicable after a claim is made, amended or corrected, the WRA will: 
 
 issue a notice of its decision to the claimant 
 repay or discharge the amount (if it decides to give effect to the claim), and 
 if the claimant had already paid the amount which is the subject of the claim, repay the amount with interest 
 
 Special rules for partnerships 
 If the amount of tax in question was originally paid by a person acting in the capacity of a responsible partner or representative partner, a claim for repayment of that amount can only be made by a responsible partner who is nominated to do so by all of the responsible partners who would have been liable to pay the amount had it been due. 
 If the WRA made an assessment or determination in relation to a person acting in the capacity of a responsible partner or representative partner, any claim for an amount of tax to be discharged can only be made by a responsible partner who is nominated to do so by all of the responsible partners who would have been liable to pay the amount had the assessment or determination been correctly made. 
 Assessment of claimant in connection with a claim 
 Where a claim for relief for overpaid tax is made, and the grounds for that claim are also grounds for the WRA to make an assessment on the claimant in respect of the tax, then the WRA can disregard certain restrictions on its ability to make an assessment. These include disregarding the expiry of a time limit. In such circumstances, the WRA assessment is not out of time if it is made before the final determination of the claim. 
 A claim is not finally determined until the amount to which it relates is final (for example, following the result of a review or appeal). 
 Contract settlements 
 In some instances, the person paying an amount to the WRA under a contract settlement and the taxpayer to whom the tax liability relates are different. 
 In such cases, any claim for repayment of an amount paid under a contract settlement must be made by the person who is liable to pay under the contract settlement (the claimant), whether or not this was the person whose tax liability was covered by the agreement (the taxpayer). This might be the case where, for example, a nominated partner in a property partnership enters into a contract settlement with the WRA on behalf of the partnership or another partner in the partnership. The nominated partner in this case would have to make the claim for repayment. 
 Where such a claim is made which then gives the WRA grounds to make an assessment against the taxpayer (see above), any amount to be repaid to the claimant can be set-off against any amount payable by the taxpayer as a result of the assessment. The obligations of both the WRA and the taxpayer are discharged to the extent (but only to the extent) that one liability is offset by the other.

645,645,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2030 Amendment of a claim," An amendment can be made by notifying the WRA, stating the grounds on which the original claim is being amended. 
 An amendment may not be made: 
 
 more than 12 months after the day on which the original claim was made, or 
 if the WRA gives notice of enquiry (see below), during the period beginning with the day on which that notice is given and ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed

646,646,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2040 Correction of a claim by the WRA," The WRA may amend a claim to correct an obvious error or omission. It will notify the claimant of such a correction. An ‘error’ includes an arithmetical mistake or an error of principle (such as entering a forename and surname the wrong way around). 
 Once a correction has been made, the WRA will give effect to the claim by discharging or repaying the amount (whichever applies) as soon as is practicable. 
 The WRA cannot make such a correction: 
 
 more than 9 months after the claim was made (that is, the date claim was received), or 
 if it gives a notice of enquiry during the period beginning with the day on which such a notice is given and ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed 
 
 The claimant may reject the correction but only by notifying the WRA that they wish to reject it within 3 months, beginning with the date on which the notice of correction was issued to the claimant.

647,647,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2050 Enquiries into a claim," The WRA may enquire into a claim (or amendment of a claim) by notifying the claimant of its intention to do so (a ‘notice of enquiry’) no later than 12 months after the day on which the claim is made (that is, the day the WRA received the claim). 
 The WRA cannot give a notice of enquiry in relation to a claim (or amendment of a claim) which has already been the subject of a previous notice of enquiry. 
 Completion of an enquiry 
 An enquiry is completed when the WRA informs and notifies the claimant (by means of a ‘closure notice’) that the enquiry is complete and states the conclusions they have reached in the enquiry. The WRA may also provisionally give effect to a claim or amendment before the closure notice is issued. 
 The closure notice must either state that: 
 
 in the WRA’s opinion, no amendments of the claim are needed, or  
 if the WRA believes that the claim is insufficient or excessive, it may amend the claim to make good or eliminate the deficiency or excess 
 
 If the enquiry is in relation to an amendment of a claim by the claimant, the WRA can only amend it so far as the deficiency or excess is attributable to the claimant’s amendment. 
 Where the WRA amends a claim following an enquiry, it must give effect to it by making any necessary adjustments (whether by way of an assessment or by repaying or discharging an amount of tax) within 30 days of the date the closure notice was issued. 
 The claimant can request a review by the WRA or appeal against a conclusion stated in, or an amendment made by, a closure notice. The claimaint must request a review by giving a notice of request to the WRA within 30 days of the closure notice being issued. The claimant may also appeal to the tribunal against a decision in a WRA closure notice or amendment. This must be done within 30 days from the date the closure notice was issued, or within 30 days from the date the WRA notifies the claimant of the outcome of its review (if requested). 
 In such a case, the tribunal may vary that amendment whether or not the variation is to the claimant’s advantage. The WRA must give effect to the variation in the same manner as would have applied to the amendment which was appealed against. 
 The claimant may also apply to the tribunal for a direction to the WRA to complete its enquiry within a specified period, for example if they feel the WRA is taking too long to carry out the enquiry. The tribunal must give such a direction unless it is satisfied that the WRA has reasonable grounds for not issuing a closure notice within the specified period.

648,648,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2060 Keeping and preserving records in relation to a claim," Anyone making a claim for an amount of tax to be repaid or discharged, must keep and preserve records in relation to that claim until the latest of the following: 
 
 12 months from the day on which the claim was made, or 
 if there has been an enquiry into the claim or into an amendment to the claim, the date on which the enquiry is completed, or 
 where the claim is amended but there is no enquiry into the amendment, the date on which the WRA is no longer able to open an enquiry into the amendment.

649,649,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2070 Unjustified enrichment," The WRA can reject a claim for an amount to be repaid or discharged if repaying or discharging that amount would unjustifiably enrich the taxpayer. 
 Unjustified enrichment may occur where the taxpayer has not ultimately borne the cost of the tax that would otherwise be repaid or discharged and has already collected it from someone else. For example, if an amount of LDT is repaid to a landfill site operator, the operator will already have collected the tax from customers paying to deposit waste at the landfill site. 
 Where a claim is made for an amount to be repaid or discharged and someone else other than the taxpayer has borne the cost of that amount, in determining whether or to what extent the taxpayer would be unjustifiably enriched, the WRA must disregard any loss or damage (except to the extent of a ‘quantified amount’) that has been incurred, or might be incurred, by the taxpayer as a result of mistaken assumptions made by the taxpayer about the operation of any ‘tax-related provisions’. 
 A ‘quantified amount’ means the amount (if any) which the taxpayer shows to be appropriate compensation for the loss or damage resulting from the mistaken assumption. 
 ‘Tax related provisions’ in this context include: 
 
 the provisions of any enactment, subordinate legislation or EU legislation (whether or not still in force) which relates to the tax (or any other connected matter) that is contained in the claim, or 
 any notice the WRA has published under or for the purposes of any such enactment or subordinate legislation 
 
 In order for the WRA to take any reimbursement arrangements into account in determining whether or not a claim would unjustifiably enrich the taxpayer, certain conditions must be included and undertakings given. 
 The conditions which must be included are that: 
 
 the taxpayer must complete the reimbursement (including any interest paid in relation the amount being reimbursed) to the relevant person(s) within 90 days of the WRA making the repayment 
 the claimant cannot deduct any fee or charge (howsoever expressed or effected) from the amount being reimbursed, including any interest paid in relation to that amount; 
 reimbursement must be provided in cash or by cheque, or electronically with the agreement of the customer 
 if any part of the amount to be reimbursed (including any interest paid in relation to that amount) has not been reimbursed to the customer by the 90 day time limit, without prior demand, the taxpayer must pay this part of the amount to the WRA no later than 30 days after the 90 day time limit has expired. Failure to do this may result in a penalty of 100% of the repayment required to be made to WRA, and 
 the taxpayer must keep specified records relating to the claim and produce them to the WRA in accordance with any information notice given to them (see below) 
 
 The undertakings the taxpayer must give are that: 
 
 they have the names and addresses of the people who have either already been reimbursed or intend to reimbursed 
 they will fully reimburse people (by cash, cheque or electronically by agreement), including any interest paid in relation the amount being reimbursed and without deducting any fee or charge (however expressed or effected), no later than 90 days after they received repayment from the WRA 
 if any part of the amount being reimbursed (including any interest paid in relation to that amount) has not been reimbursed by the 90 day time limit, without prior demand, the taxpayer will pay this part of the amount to the WRA within 30 days of the end of the 90-day period, and 
 they will keep the records as described further below, and will comply with any notice issued requiring them to provide those records 
 
 These undertakings must: 
 
 be given to the WRA before or at the same time as the claim is made, and 
 be signed and dated and in writing

650,650,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2080 Keeping records in relation to unjustified enrichment," The taxpayer must keep the following records relating to reimbursement arrangements: 
 
 the names and addresses of the people who have been reimbursed or intend to be reimbursed 
 the total amount reimbursed to each such person, including in all cases receipts from those reimbursed acknowledging how much has been reimbursed and which give the date of reimbursement 
 the amount of interest included in each total amount reimbursed to each customer, and 
 the date that each reimbursement is made 
 
 These records must be kept for the latest of: 
 
 a period of 12 months from the date of the claim relating to the reimbursement arrangements 
 where there is an enquiry into the claim, or into an amendment to the claim, the day on which the enquiry is completed 
 where the claim is amended and there is no enquiry into the amendment, the day on which the WRA ceases to have the power to enquire into the amendment 
 
 Failure to keep the above records as required may result in a penalty. 
 If the WRA wishes to see these records, it will notify the taxpayer in writing, stating the place, time and date at or on which the records must be produced. The WRA can notify the taxpayer before or after (or both before and after) it has repaid the amount in the claim. If the taxpayer fails to comply with such a notice they may be liable to a penalty.

651,651,Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Relief in case of excessive assessment or overpaid tax,TCMA/2090 Rejecting a claim for tax to be repaid or discharged," The WRA can reject a claim for an amount to be repaid or discharged if repaying or discharging that amount would unjustly enrich the taxpayer. 
 Where this is the case, the taxpayer can give a notice of review or appeal against the WRA’s decision to reject the claim. 
 The WRA may also reject a claim if it applies to any of the following cases: 
 
 The amount of tax paid, or liable to be paid, is excessive because of either a mistake in the claim or the claim is made, or has failed to be made, by mistake. 
 The claimant may seek relief (or will be able to seek relief) by taking other steps, such as amending their tax return or making a tax return following a WRA determination. 
 The claimant:
	 
 could have sought relief by taking other steps (see above) but the time period for doing so has now expired, and 
 the claimant knew (or should have reasonably known before the end of that period) that such a relief was available to them. 
 
 
 The grounds for the claim:
	 
 have already been put to a court or tribunal in the course of an appeal relating to the amount that has been paid or is liable to be paid, or 
 have already been put to the WRA in the course of a review or appeal relating to the amount that has been paid or is liable to be paid, and the grounds are treated as having been determined by the tribunal by virtue of a settlement agreement being entered into. 
 
 
 The claimant knew (or should have reasonably known) about the grounds for the claim before the latest of any of the following:
	 
 the date on which a relevant appeal (in the course of which the ground could have been put forward) was determined by a court or tribunal, or is treated as having been so determined 
 the date on which the claimant withdrew a relevant appeal to a court or tribunal, or 
 the end of the period in which the claimant was entitled to make a relevant appeal to a court or tribunal. ‘Relevant appeal’ means an appeal by the claimant relating to the amount paid or liable to be paid which is the subject of the claim. 
 
 
 The amount in question was paid or is liable to be paid either:
	 
 in consequence of proceedings enforcing the payment of that amount brought by the WRA against the claimant, or 
 in accordance with an agreement between the WRA and the claimant settling such proceedings. 
 
 
 The amount paid, or liable to be paid, is excessive because of a mistake in calculating the claimant’s liability to devolved tax, and that liability was calculated in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time. This does not apply where the amount paid, or liable to be paid, is tax which has been charged contrary to EU law. Tax is charged contrary to EU law if, in the circumstances in question, the tax charged is contrary to the provisions relating to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital in Titles II and IV of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or the provisions of any subsequent treaty replacing these provisions. 
 
 In addition, the WRA may refuse a claim for relief from a landfill site operator where the relief claimed relates to an amount of tax that has not been paid.

652,652,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1010 Filing date," The ‘filing date’ is the date by which a tax return needs to be submitted to the WRA. For tax returns completed online, the return is filed on the day it is submitted. If a paper return is posted, the return is filed on the date it is received by the WRA.

653,653,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1020 Amending a tax return," The taxpayer may amend their tax return within 12 months of the filing date by notifying the WRA.  
 An amendment made when the tax return in question is under enquiry does not take effect until the WRA issues a closure notice completing the enquiry. However, the amendment does not take effect where the WRA closure notice states it has either taken the amendment into account in reaching its conclusions, or that the WRA has concluded the amendment to be incorrect.

654,654,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1030 WRA correction of a tax return," The WRA may amend a tax return to correct an obvious error or omission. This could be an arithmetical mistake or an ‘error of principle’ such as entering a forename and surname the wrong way around.  
 The WRA will issue a notice to the taxpayer giving effect to any such corrections. The WRA cannot make a correction more than 9 months after receiving a tax return.  
 The taxpayer may reject corrections made by the WRA by notifying the WRA within 3 months of the correction being issued, or by amending the tax return within 12 months of the filing date. 
 If, as a result of a correction, an additional amount of tax is payable, the taxpayer must pay this within 30 days of the notice of correction being issued.

655,655,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1040 Giving notice of an enquiry," The WRA must notify the taxpayer if it intends to open an enquiry into a tax return (a ‘notice of enquiry’) within 12 months of the date on which a return was due to have been filed, or, if later, the day on which WRA actually it received the return (an ‘enquiry period’). If a return has been amended by the taxpayer, the enquiry period will instead be within 12 months of the date of the amendment. 
 The WRA may open an enquiry after the enquiry period if the following conditions are met: 
 
 it is a tax return in relation to a land transaction 
 a further tax return has been made in respect of the same land transaction 
 WRA has opened an enquiry into the further tax return 
 WRA believes it necessary to enquire into the earlier tax return 
 
 An enquiry cannot be opened if the return has already been the subject of a previous enquiry. However, if the WRA closes the enquiry and the taxpayer subsequently amends the return, the WRA may issue a further notice of enquiry but this enquiry will be limited to matters relating to or affected by the amendment.

656,656,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1050 Scope of enquiries," An enquiry can be in relation to anything contained, or required to be contained in a tax return, that relates to: 
 
 whether the taxpayer is liable to pay the tax, and 
 the amount of tax payable 
 
 If a notice of enquiry has been issued following an amendment to a tax return, if the WRA has previously closed an enquiry into the return, the new enquiry is limited to matters related to the amendment or matters affected by the amendment.

657,657,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1060 WRA amendment of a tax return during an enquiry," If an enquiry into a tax return is in progress and the WRA forms the opinion that: 
 
 the amount of tax payable as stated in a self-assessed tax return is lower than it should be, and 
 unless the deficit is paid immediately, there could be a loss of devolved tax 
 
 the WRA may issue a notice to the taxpayer amending the tax return to bring the additional tax into charge. 
 If the scope of an enquiry is limited to matters arising from a taxpayer amendment because a previous enquiry into the original return has been completed, then any amendment by the WRA in these circumstances can only be made if the tax deficit mentioned above is as a result of the amendment made by the taxpayer. 
 The taxpayer must pay any amount or additional amount of tax (and, where applicable, interest) chargeable as a result of a WRA amendment of a return during an enquiry within 30 days beginning with the day on which the WRA issued the notice of amendment. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-tax-returns-enquiries-and-assessments-technical
658,658,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1070 Referrals to a tribunal during an enquiry," When an enquiry is in progress, any questions arising from the tax return can be referred to an appropriate tribunal for determination, providing that the WRA and the taxpayer agree. More than one referral can be made in relation to an enquiry and the taxpayer may withdraw a referral at any time. 
 While proceedings on a referral are in progress (that is, before a determination is made or a referral has been made and not withdrawn), the WRA cannot issue a closure notice and the taxpayer cannot make an application to give a closure notice. 
 A determination of a referred matter by the tribunal is binding on the taxpayer and the WRA in the same way and to the same extent as a decision on a preliminary plea in an appeal. A preliminary plea is a plea-in-law that raises a legal issue that does not relate to the merits of the proceedings but if sustained, could result in the proceedings (or part of them) being dismissed. 
 The WRA must take the determination into account both in reaching its conclusions on the enquiry and in formulating any amendments to the tax return that may be required to give effect to these conclusions. 
 The question that has been determined may not be reopened on an appeal unless it had been determined as a preliminary plea (see above) in that appeal.

659,659,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1080 Completion of an enquiry," An enquiry is completed when the WRA issues the taxpayer with a ‘closure notice’ stating that the enquiry is complete and the conclusions from the enquiry. 
 The closure notice must either state that: 
 
 in WRA’s opinion, no amendments are required to the tax return; or 
 in WRA’s opinion an amendment is required and it will make the necessary amendments to the tax return to give effect to its conclusions 
 
 If the closure notice issued by the WRA amends a tax return, the taxpayer cannot then make their own amendments, even if the time limit for normally being able to do so has not expired. If the taxpayer disagrees with the conclusions in the closure notice, they may request a review of the decision by the WRA or appeal to the tribunal. Full guidance on reviews and appeals is available at TCMA/5000. 
 The taxpayer must pay any amount or additional amount of tax (and, where applicable, interest) payable as a result of a WRA amendment within 30 days, beginning with the date on which the notice of the amendment was issued. 
 The taxpayer can apply to the tribunal for a direction that the WRA must give a closure notice within a specified period (for example, if it is felt the WRA is taking too long to complete the enquiry). The tribunal must give this direction unless it is satisfied that the WRA has reasonable grounds for not issuing the closure notice within that period.

660,660,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1090 WRA Determinations," If the WRA believes that the taxpayer is liable to pay tax and they have not filed a tax return by the relevant filing date (see TCMA/1010) a ‘WRA determination’ may be made of the amount of tax it believes is chargeable. 
 The WRA must notify the taxpayer of the determination and they must pay the tax within 30 days of the notice being issued. 
 The WRA may not make a determination more than 4 years after the relevant filing date. The relevant filing date is the date by which the WRA believes the return was required to be made. 
 WRA determination superseded by tax return 
 If the taxpayer submits a tax return after receiving notice of a WRA determination, the return supersedes the determination. 
 This must be submitted by the later of either: 
 
 4 years after the WRA’s powers to make a determination became exercisable (that is, the relevant filing date), or 
 12 months beginning with the date the WRA determination was issued 
 
 If the taxpayer’s return is submitted whilst proceedings are underway (but are not concluded) to recover any tax charged by the WRA’s determination, then the proceedings may continue as if they were proceedings for the recovery of any tax calculated by the self-assessment which is due and payable and has not been paid.

661,661,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1100 WRA assessments," If the WRA believes that any of the following situations may apply: 
 
 an amount of devolved tax that ought to have been assessed has not been assessed 
 an assessment is or has become insufficient (that is, the WRA is of the view that the taxpayer is liable to more tax than it previously thought), or 
 any relief claimed by the taxpayer or which has been given, is or has become excessive 
 
 then the WRA may make an assessment of the amount, or additional amount of tax that in its view the taxpayer should be charged. 
 The WRA can also make an assessment (also known as a ‘WRA assessment’) against any amount of tax and associated interest which has (but should not have) been repaid to the taxpayer. The WRA can recover this amount in the same manner as if it were unpaid tax.

662,662,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1110 Conditions for making a WRA assessment," A WRA assessment may only be made in the following circumstances: 
 
 when any of the situations described in TCMA/1100 were brought about carelessly or deliberately by the taxpayer, a person acting on the taxpayer’s behalf, or a partner in the same partnership as the taxpayer 
 the WRA is no longer entitled to issue an enquiry notice or it has completed an enquiry into a tax return and it could not have reasonably been expected to have been aware that one of the situations outlined in TCMA/1100 had arisen based on the information available to it at the time 
 the WRA makes an adjustment under the general anti-avoidance rule 
 
 However, the WRA is not able to make a WRA assessment if: 
 
 any of the situations described in TCMA/1100 are attributable to a mistake in a return as to the basis on which the tax liability ought to have been calculated; and 
 the return was made on the basis of practice generally prevailing at the time the return was made 
 
 Situations brought about carelessly or deliberately 
 A situation is brought about ‘carelessly’ by the taxpayer failing to take reasonable care to avoid bringing about that situation. The taxpayer (or the person who provided the information on their behalf) will also be treated as having brought about a situation carelessly if they: 
 
 discover some time later that the information provided was inaccurate, and 
 failed to take reasonable steps to inform the WRA 
 
 ‘Deliberately’ means a situation is brought about through a deliberate action by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf, or a partner in the same partnership as the taxpayer. This includes situations arising as a result of a deliberate inaccuracy in a document given to the WRA by either the taxpayer or someone on their behalf.

663,663,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1120 Time limits for making a WRA assessment," The general rule is that the WRA can only make a WRA assessment up to 4 years after the relevant date (see TCMA/1010). The relevant date generally means the filing date, unless: 
 
 a return is made if this is after the filing date, in which case it is the date the return was made, or  
 no tax return has been made, in which case it is the date by which the WRA believes the return should have been made 
 
 However, if the WRA believes a situation described in TCMA/1100 is brought about carelessly by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf or another partner in the same partnership, it can make an assessment up to 6 years after the relevant date. 
 If the WRA believes a situation described in TCMA/1100 is brought about deliberately by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf or another partner in the same partnership, it can make an assessment up to 20 years after the relevant date. 
 If WRA believes the taxpayer has been repaid tax that they should not have been, it may make an assessment as long as it is within 12 months of the day on which the repayment was made to the taxpayer. 
 If the taxpayer has died, a WRA assessment must be made on the personal representatives within 4 years of the date of the death, and an assessment cannot be made in respect of a relevant date more than 6 years before the death. 
 If the taxpayer wishes to object to the making of a WRA assessment on the ground that the time limit that it has to make it has expired, they must do this by giving a notice of review or appealing against the assessment. Guidance on reviews and appeals against WRA decisions can be found at TCMA/5000.

664,664,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1130 Procedure for making an assessment," The WRA will issue a notice to the taxpayer (or, in the case of a WRA assessment concerning excessive repayment of tax, the person who the repayment was made to) when it makes a WRA assessment. 
 The taxpayer must pay the amount payable (including any penalties and interest) within 30 days beginning with the day on which the WRA assessment notice is issued.

665,665,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1140 Duty to keep and preserve records where a tax return is required," When the taxpayer is required to make a tax return they must keep and preserve records to demonstrate that the tax return is correct and complete. Records include both paper or digital records, and supporting documentation such as accounts, books, deeds, contracts, vouchers and receipts. 
 The taxpayer must keep these records until the later of the relevant date and the day on which either an enquiry into that tax return is completed or the enquiry period ends (see TCMA/1080). 
 The ‘relevant date’ is the later of 6 years from the filing date or 6 years from the date  a taxpayer amendment to the return was made (see TCMA/1020). Alternatively, the ‘relevant date’ may be an earlier date specified by the WRA. 
 Further guidance on specific record-keeping requirements under the Landfill Disposals Tax and Land Transaction Tax is available under the relevant guidance sections.

666,666,"Land Transaction Tax for professionals / Tax collection and management guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1150 Duty to keep and preserve records for land transactions where a tax return is not required," If a land transaction does not require a tax return (for example when the transaction is not a notifiable transaction), the buyer must keep and preserve records until the end of the ‘relevant date’ to demonstrate that no tax return was required. 
 The relevant date is the sixth year anniversary of the date of the transaction, unless WRA specifies an earlier date.

669,669,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2010 Claiming a refund," There are 3 circumstances under which a claim for a tax refund may be made: 
 
 If you believe that you have been assessed for tax more than once for the same transaction (under section 62 TCMA) 
 If you believe that you have paid an amount of tax that was not chargeable, or if a WRA assessment or determination has been made that you are chargeable to an amount of tax and you disagree (section 63 TCMA) 
 Where you have paid an amount of tax according to a set of rates and bands, but those rates and bands are subsequently rejected by the National Assembly for Wales (section 63A TCMA) 
 
 We have developed specific  online forms for different refund claims(https://www.gov.wales/claim-land-transaction-tax-refund) . 
 Where you have paid higher rates on your residential LTT transaction but have subsequently sold your previous main residence and wish to make a claim for the higher rates portion of the tax in accordance with the rules, this will be treated as an amendment under section 41 TCMA if it is made within 12 months of the date of the return. Outside of the 12 months, this will be treated as a claim under section 63 TCMA. We have a specific form for higher rates refunds, which can be found by following the link above.  
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-claiming-refund-technical-guidance
670,670,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2020 Making a claim," As outlined in TCMA/2010(/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-relief-case-excessive-assessment-or-overpaid-tax#6493), we have specific  online forms for different types of refund claims(https://www.gov.wales/claim-land-transaction-tax-refund)  which should be used wherever possible. 
 When making a repayment claim, the claimant must: 
 
 make the claim within 4 years beginning with the day after the filing date for the tax return to which the payment by way of devolved tax, or the assessment or determination, relates 
 provide a declaration that all the particulars given in the claim are correctly stated to the best of their information and belief, and 
 keep and preserve certain records which may be needed to make a correct and complete claim. The claimant may be liable to a penalty if they fail to keep and preserve these records as required 
 
 The online claim form should include the following information: 
 
 confirmation of which of the three circumstances outlined in  TCMA/2010(/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-relief-case-excessive-assessment-or-overpaid-tax#6493) 
 a statement of the amount of devolved tax which will need to be discharged or repaid to give effect to the claim 
 the grounds on which the claimant believes the double assessment or overpayment of tax has occurred, including details of any previous charge, and  
 supporting statements, documents and any other information which the WRA might reasonably require to determine whether and, if so, the extent to which the claim is correct 
 
 The WRA will only accept a claim if the relevant information and documentary evidence is provided by or on behalf of the claimant. 
 A claim should not be made by including it in a tax return. 
 Requests for refunds outside of the time limits to amend the return will generally be treated by WRA as a potential claim under section 62, 63 or 63A TCMA.  
 Giving effect to a claim 
 As soon as practicable after a claim is made, amended or corrected, the WRA will: 
 
 issue a notice of its decision to the claimant 
 repay or discharge the amount (if it decides to give effect to the claim), and 
 if the claimant had already paid the amount which is the subject of the claim, repay the amount with interest 
 
 Special rules for partnerships 
 If the amount of tax in question was originally paid by a person acting in the capacity of a responsible partner or representative partner, a claim for repayment of that amount can only be made by a responsible partner who is nominated to do so by all of the responsible partners who would have been liable to pay the amount had it been due. 
 If the WRA made an assessment or determination in relation to a person acting in the capacity of a responsible partner or representative partner, any claim for an amount of tax to be discharged can only be made by a responsible partner who is nominated to do so by all of the responsible partners who would have been liable to pay the amount had the assessment or determination been correctly made. 
 Assessment of claimant in connection with a claim 
 Where a claim for relief for overpaid tax is made, and the grounds for that claim are also grounds for the WRA to make an assessment on the claimant in respect of the tax, then the WRA can disregard certain restrictions on its ability to make an assessment. These include disregarding the expiry of a time limit. In such circumstances, the WRA assessment is not out of time if it is made before the final determination of the claim. 
 A claim is not finally determined until the amount to which it relates is final (for example, following the result of a review or appeal). 
 Contract settlements 
 In some instances, the person paying an amount to the WRA under a contract settlement and the taxpayer to whom the tax liability relates are different. 
 In such cases, any claim for repayment of an amount paid under a contract settlement must be made by the person who is liable to pay under the contract settlement (the claimant), whether or not this was the person whose tax liability was covered by the agreement (the taxpayer). This might be the case where, for example, a nominated partner in a property partnership enters into a contract settlement with the WRA on behalf of the partnership or another partner in the partnership. The nominated partner in this case would have to make the claim for repayment. 
 Where such a claim is made which then gives the WRA grounds to make an assessment against the taxpayer (see above), any amount to be repaid to the claimant can be set-off against any amount payable by the taxpayer as a result of the assessment. The obligations of both the WRA and the taxpayer are discharged to the extent (but only to the extent) that one liability is offset by the other.

671,671,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2030 Amendment of a claim," An amendment can be made by notifying the WRA, stating the grounds on which the original claim is being amended. 
 An amendment may not be made: 
 
 more than 12 months after the day on which the original claim was made, or 
 if the WRA gives notice of enquiry (see below), during the period beginning with the day on which that notice is given and ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed

672,672,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2040 Correction of a claim by the WRA," The WRA may amend a claim to correct an obvious error or omission. It will notify the claimant of such a correction. An ‘error’ includes an arithmetical mistake or an error of principle (such as entering a forename and surname the wrong way around). 
 Once a correction has been made, the WRA will give effect to the claim by discharging or repaying the amount (whichever applies) as soon as is practicable. 
 The WRA cannot make such a correction: 
 
 more than 9 months after the claim was made (that is, the date claim was received), or 
 if it gives a notice of enquiry during the period beginning with the day on which such a notice is given and ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed 
 
 The claimant may reject the correction but only by notifying the WRA that they wish to reject it within 3 months, beginning with the date on which the notice of correction was issued to the claimant.

673,673,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2050 Enquiries into a claim," The WRA may enquire into a claim (or amendment of a claim) by notifying the claimant of its intention to do so (a ‘notice of enquiry’) no later than 12 months after the day on which the claim is made (that is, the day the WRA received the claim). 
 The WRA cannot give a notice of enquiry in relation to a claim (or amendment of a claim) which has already been the subject of a previous notice of enquiry. 
 Completion of an enquiry 
 An enquiry is completed when the WRA informs and notifies the claimant (by means of a ‘closure notice’) that the enquiry is complete and states the conclusions they have reached in the enquiry. The WRA may also provisionally give effect to a claim or amendment before the closure notice is issued. 
 The closure notice must either state that: 
 
 in the WRA’s opinion, no amendments of the claim are needed, or  
 if the WRA believes that the claim is insufficient or excessive, it may amend the claim to make good or eliminate the deficiency or excess 
 
 If the enquiry is in relation to an amendment of a claim by the claimant, the WRA can only amend it so far as the deficiency or excess is attributable to the claimant’s amendment. 
 Where the WRA amends a claim following an enquiry, it must give effect to it by making any necessary adjustments (whether by way of an assessment or by repaying or discharging an amount of tax) within 30 days of the date the closure notice was issued. 
 The claimant can request a review by the WRA or appeal against a conclusion stated in, or an amendment made by, a closure notice. The claimaint must request a review by giving a notice of request to the WRA within 30 days of the closure notice being issued. The claimant may also appeal to the tribunal against a decision in a WRA closure notice or amendment. This must be done within 30 days from the date the closure notice was issued, or within 30 days from the date the WRA notifies the claimant of the outcome of its review (if requested). 
 In such a case, the tribunal may vary that amendment whether or not the variation is to the claimant’s advantage. The WRA must give effect to the variation in the same manner as would have applied to the amendment which was appealed against. 
 The claimant may also apply to the tribunal for a direction to the WRA to complete its enquiry within a specified period, for example if they feel the WRA is taking too long to carry out the enquiry. The tribunal must give such a direction unless it is satisfied that the WRA has reasonable grounds for not issuing a closure notice within the specified period.

674,674,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2060 Keeping and preserving records in relation to a claim," Anyone making a claim for an amount of tax to be repaid or discharged, must keep and preserve records in relation to that claim until the latest of the following: 
 
 12 months from the day on which the claim was made, or 
 if there has been an enquiry into the claim or into an amendment to the claim, the date on which the enquiry is completed, or 
 where the claim is amended but there is no enquiry into the amendment, the date on which the WRA is no longer able to open an enquiry into the amendment.

675,675,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2070 Unjustified enrichment," The WRA can reject a claim for an amount to be repaid or discharged if repaying or discharging that amount would unjustifiably enrich the taxpayer. 
 Unjustified enrichment may occur where the taxpayer has not ultimately borne the cost of the tax that would otherwise be repaid or discharged and has already collected it from someone else. For example, if an amount of LDT is repaid to a landfill site operator, the operator will already have collected the tax from customers paying to deposit waste at the landfill site. 
 Where a claim is made for an amount to be repaid or discharged and someone else other than the taxpayer has borne the cost of that amount, in determining whether or to what extent the taxpayer would be unjustifiably enriched, the WRA must disregard any loss or damage (except to the extent of a ‘quantified amount’) that has been incurred, or might be incurred, by the taxpayer as a result of mistaken assumptions made by the taxpayer about the operation of any ‘tax-related provisions’. 
 A ‘quantified amount’ means the amount (if any) which the taxpayer shows to be appropriate compensation for the loss or damage resulting from the mistaken assumption. 
 ‘Tax related provisions’ in this context include: 
 
 the provisions of any enactment, subordinate legislation or EU legislation (whether or not still in force) which relates to the tax (or any other connected matter) that is contained in the claim, or 
 any notice the WRA has published under or for the purposes of any such enactment or subordinate legislation 
 
 In order for the WRA to take any reimbursement arrangements into account in determining whether or not a claim would unjustifiably enrich the taxpayer, certain conditions must be included and undertakings given. 
 The conditions which must be included are that: 
 
 the taxpayer must complete the reimbursement (including any interest paid in relation the amount being reimbursed) to the relevant person(s) within 90 days of the WRA making the repayment 
 the claimant cannot deduct any fee or charge (howsoever expressed or effected) from the amount being reimbursed, including any interest paid in relation to that amount; 
 reimbursement must be provided in cash or by cheque, or electronically with the agreement of the customer 
 if any part of the amount to be reimbursed (including any interest paid in relation to that amount) has not been reimbursed to the customer by the 90 day time limit, without prior demand, the taxpayer must pay this part of the amount to the WRA no later than 30 days after the 90 day time limit has expired. Failure to do this may result in a penalty of 100% of the repayment required to be made to WRA, and 
 the taxpayer must keep specified records relating to the claim and produce them to the WRA in accordance with any information notice given to them (see below) 
 
 The undertakings the taxpayer must give are that: 
 
 they have the names and addresses of the people who have either already been reimbursed or intend to reimbursed 
 they will fully reimburse people (by cash, cheque or electronically by agreement), including any interest paid in relation the amount being reimbursed and without deducting any fee or charge (however expressed or effected), no later than 90 days after they received repayment from the WRA 
 if any part of the amount being reimbursed (including any interest paid in relation to that amount) has not been reimbursed by the 90 day time limit, without prior demand, the taxpayer will pay this part of the amount to the WRA within 30 days of the end of the 90-day period, and 
 they will keep the records as described further below, and will comply with any notice issued requiring them to provide those records 
 
 These undertakings must: 
 
 be given to the WRA before or at the same time as the claim is made, and 
 be signed and dated and in writing

676,676,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2080 Keeping records in relation to unjustified enrichment," The taxpayer must keep the following records relating to reimbursement arrangements: 
 
 the names and addresses of the people who have been reimbursed or intend to be reimbursed 
 the total amount reimbursed to each such person, including in all cases receipts from those reimbursed acknowledging how much has been reimbursed and which give the date of reimbursement 
 the amount of interest included in each total amount reimbursed to each customer, and 
 the date that each reimbursement is made 
 
 These records must be kept for the latest of:

 where the claim is amended and there is no enquiry into the amendment, the day on which the WRA ceases to have the power to enquire into the amendment 
 
 Failure to keep the above records as required may result in a penalty. 
 If the WRA wishes to see these records, it will notify the taxpayer in writing, stating the place, time and date at or on which the records must be produced. The WRA can notify the taxpayer before or after (or both before and after) it has repaid the amount in the claim. If the taxpayer fails to comply with such a notice they may be liable to a penalty.

677,677,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Claiming a refund,TCMA/2090 Rejecting a claim for tax to be repaid or discharged," The WRA can reject a claim for an amount to be repaid or discharged if repaying or discharging that amount would unjustly enrich the taxpayer. 
 Where this is the case, the taxpayer can give a notice of review or appeal against the WRA’s decision to reject the claim. 
 The WRA may also reject a claim if it applies to any of the following cases: 
 
 The amount of tax paid, or liable to be paid, is excessive because of either a mistake in the claim or the claim is made, or has failed to be made, by mistake. 
 The claimant may seek relief (or will be able to seek relief) by taking other steps, such as amending their tax return or making a tax return following a WRA determination. 
 The claimant:
	 
 could have sought relief by taking other steps (see above) but the time period for doing so has now expired, and 
 the claimant knew (or should have reasonably known before the end of that period) that such a relief was available to them. 
 
 
 The grounds for the claim:
	 
 have already been put to a court or tribunal in the course of an appeal relating to the amount that has been paid or is liable to be paid, or 
 have already been put to the WRA in the course of a review or appeal relating to the amount that has been paid or is liable to be paid, and the grounds are treated as having been determined by the tribunal by virtue of a settlement agreement being entered into. 
 
 
 The claimant knew (or should have reasonably known) about the grounds for the claim before the latest of any of the following:
	 
 the date on which a relevant appeal (in the course of which the ground could have been put forward) was determined by a court or tribunal, or is treated as having been so determined 
 the date on which the claimant withdrew a relevant appeal to a court or tribunal, or 
 the end of the period in which the claimant was entitled to make a relevant appeal to a court or tribunal. ‘Relevant appeal’ means an appeal by the claimant relating to the amount paid or liable to be paid which is the subject of the claim. 
 
 
 The amount in question was paid or is liable to be paid either:
	 
 in consequence of proceedings enforcing the payment of that amount brought by the WRA against the claimant, or 
 in accordance with an agreement between the WRA and the claimant settling such proceedings. 
 
 
 The amount paid, or liable to be paid, is excessive because of a mistake in calculating the claimant’s liability to devolved tax, and that liability was calculated in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time. This does not apply where the amount paid, or liable to be paid, is tax which has been charged contrary to EU law. Tax is charged contrary to EU law if, in the circumstances in question, the tax charged is contrary to the provisions relating to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital in Titles II and IV of Part 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or the provisions of any subsequent treaty replacing these provisions. 
 
 In addition, the WRA may refuse a claim for relief from a landfill site operator where the relief claimed relates to an amount of tax that has not been paid.

678,678,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3010 Introduction," It is important that the collection and management of Welsh devolved taxes operates fairly and efficiently. The WRA recognises that most taxpayers want to comply with their obligations. 
 The WRA has various powers to help check that taxpayers meet their tax responsibilities and pay the right amount of tax at the right time, to ensure that the taxes are operating as intended and to detect and to deter the minority who do not comply with their obligations. 
 To encourage compliance and deter non-compliance a range of fixed amount, daily and tax-geared civil penalties apply to the devolved taxes. The WRA has the power in certain circumstances, and for certain penalties, to suspend or waive a penalty. 
 This section provides guidance on the civil penalties regime which applies to the devolved taxes and which is contained in TCMA (and mainly Part 5 of that Act), including the assessment and enforcement rules underpinning each penalty. 
 Taxpayers have the right to request a review or appeal to the Tribunal in relation to any penalty issued by WRA. 
 Taxpayers are not liable to any penalty described in this guidance if they have already been convicted of a criminal offence arising out of the same conduct. This is known as the ‘double jeopardy’ rule. 
 The guidance in this section is structured as follows: 
 
 Penalties and the Human Rights Act 1998 
 Penalties for failure to make a tax return 
 Penalties for failure to pay tax 
 Penalties for failure to notify under-assessment/under-determination 
 Penalties relating to record-keeping 
 Penalties relating to investigations 
 Penalties relating to inaccuracies, reasonable care and suspension 
 Determining and calculating the penalty amount 
 Reasonable excuse 
 Reduction for disclosure 
 Special circumstances 
 Appeals and reviews of penalty decisions 
 More than one penalty chargeable

679,679,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3020 Penalties and the Human Rights Act 1998," Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) is incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Article 6 provides a person with various rights and safeguards when WRA is deciding whether to impose certain penalties. 
 The ECHR and case-law defines certain penalties as “criminal” penalties, such as penalties imposed because of deliberate behaviour. Such penalties are not criminal under UK law (i.e. they are civil penalties), although they are regarded as “criminal” for the purposes of the ECHR. 
 Because these types of penalties are regarded as criminal by the ECHR, taxpayers are afforded rights by Article 6. These include: 
 
 the right for a person to be informed promptly of the nature of, and reason for, any charge against them 
 an entitlement to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time, and 
 the right not to self-incriminate 
 
 If WRA believes that a penalty that might be due is likely to engage Article 6, the person who may be liable to the penalty will be notified of this fact.

680,680,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3030 Penalties for failure to make a tax return," A taxpayer required to make a tax return is liable to a £100 penalty if they fail to make a tax return on or before the filing date. 
 For LTT, the filing date is 30 days from the effective date of the transaction. This is usually the completion date. 
 For LDT, the filing date is the last working day of the month following the month in which the accounting period ends (see LDTA/5010 and LDTA/5020 for more information). 
 If the failure to make a tax return continues, the taxpayer is liable to further penalties, as follows: 
 
 
 
 Failure to make a tax return 
 Penalty 
 
 
 
 
 1 day late 
 £100 
 
 
 6 months late 
 Extra £300 or 5% of any unpaid tax, whichever is greater 
 
 
 12 months late 
 Another £300; or 5% of any unpaid tax, whichever is greater 
 
 
 
 However, if the taxpayer withholds information that would enable or assist the WRA to assess their liability to a devolved tax, the penalty amount is the greater of: 
 
 £300, or 
 an amount not exceeding 95% of the amount of the devolved tax to which the person would have been liable if the tax return had been made 
 
 Any penalties in this section must be paid within a period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the notice of the penalty is issued, unless the taxpayer requests a review or appeals to the tribunal. 
 The WRA may reduce a penalty for failure to make a tax return if the taxpayer discloses information which has been withheld as a result of that failure. 
 LDT-specific penalties for multiple failures to make tax returns 
 Where a taxpayer becomes liable to a penalty for failure to make a return for landfill disposals tax (LDT), further failures to make returns within a defined penalty period will attract a higher penalty rate. 
 The penalty period begins with the day after the filing date for the tax return, and ends 12 months later. The penalty period may be extended on the same basis where there are further failures to make tax returns. 
 The penalties are as follows: 
 
 
 
 Initial failure within the penalty period 
 £200 
 
 
 Second failure within the penalty period 
 £300 
 
 
 Third and subsequent failures within the penalty period 
 £400 each time 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Company A is required to make a return for the period 1 April 2018 to 30 to June 2018 on or before the filing date of 31 July 2018, but fails to do so. The WRA imposes a penalty of £100 for failure to make a return. The penalty period runs from 1 August 2018 to 31 July 2019. 
 If Company A then fails to make a return for the period 1 October 2018 to 31 December 2018, this failure falls within the penalty period. The company is liable to a penalty of £200 and the penalty period is extended to 31 January 2020. A third failure within the penalty period will give rise to a £300 penalty and the fourth and subsequent failures to penalties of £400.

 Penalty for failure to repay a tax credit on time 
 The WRA may impose a penalty where the WRA issues a taxpayer with an assessment to recover an amount of tax credit that ought not to have been paid (or set off against a tax liability), or that has become excessive, and the amount assessed is not paid by the taxpayer on time. The penalty is 5% of the amount payable as a result of the WRA assessment.

682,682,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3050 Penalty for failure to notify under-assessment or under-determination," A taxpayer is liable to a penalty if they receive a WRA determination or assessment that understates their tax liability, and they fail to take reasonable steps to notify the WRA of this understatement within 30 days of the date that the determination or assessment was issued. 
 The penalty amount will not exceed 30% of the potential lost revenue. 
 In deciding what steps (if any) were reasonable, the WRA must consider whether the taxpayer knew, or should have known, about the under-determination or under-assessment. 
 Assessing and paying the penalty 
 The WRA must make an assessment and notify the taxpayer of their liability to this penalty (stating the period against which the penalty has been assessed) within the period of 12 months beginning with: 
 
 the end of the ‘appeal period’ (see below) for a decision which corrects the inaccuracy or understatement (such as a decision to make a WRA assessment), or 
 if there is no such assessment by the WRA to the tax concerned above, the date on which the inaccuracy or understatement is corrected 
 
 The ‘appeal period’ is the period during which an appeal against a WRA decision could be brought, or the period during which an appeal that has been brought has not been finally determined or withdrawn. 
 Subject to the above time limit, the WRA can make a supplementary assessment of the taxpayer’s liability to this penalty if an earlier assessment made by the WRA was calculated using an underestimate of the potential lost revenue.

 the WRA is satisfied that any facts it reasonably requires to be proved (and which would have been proved by the records not kept or preserved) are proved by other documentary evidence which has been provided to it, or 
 the taxpayer satisfies the WRA or (on appeal) the tribunal that there is a reasonable excuse for their failure to comply with these provisions 
 
 The WRA must make an assessment and notify the person liable to the penalty within 12 months of the date on which it first believed the taxpayer had failed to comply with their obligations to keep and preserve records.

 The WRA will charge interest on the amount of any unpaid penalty from the date following the date on which the penalty is due to be paid until it is paid. 
 A penalty for failure to keep and preserve records is treated as a relevant amount for enforcement purposes. This means that the WRA has the same debt enforcement and recovery powers in relation to this penalty (and other penalties) as it has in relation to tax.

684,684,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3070 Penalties relating to investigations," A taxpayer is liable to a fixed penalty of £300 if they: 
 
 fail to comply with an information notice, or 
 deliberately obstruct the WRA (or a person authorised by the WRA) in the course of an inspection or in the exercise of a power that has been approved by the tribunal under section 108 TCMA 
 
 If the failure or obstruction continues after the date on which this first fixed penalty of £300 is imposed, the taxpayer is liable to a further penalty (or penalties) of up to £60 for each subsequent day on which the failure or obstruction continues. 
 This daily penalty amount may be increased if, in relation to an unidentified third party notice, the failure or obstruction continues over a longer period of time. WRA may only impose an increased daily default penalty in relation to this type of information notice where: 
 
 the failure continues for more than 30 days from the date of the penalty notice 
 the notice recipient has been told that an application is going to be made for an increased penalty, and 
 the tribunal, on application by WRA, determines that a penalty may be imposed. 
 
 The tribunal has to take into consideration various factors, such as the cost to the notice recipient of complying with the request. The tribunal cannot set a penalty amount exceeding £1000 per applicable day. 
 Alternatively, in addition to the fixed £300 and ‘up to’ £60 daily penalties, the taxpayer may be liable to an additional penalty amount. This amount would be determined by the Upper Tribunal. 
 The additional penalty would be incurred where the WRA has reason to believe that, as a result of continued failure or obstruction, the amount of tax that the taxpayer has paid (or is likely to pay), or the amount that the person has paid (or is likely to pay) in respect of a tax credit, is significantly less than it would otherwise have been for that failure or obstruction. 
 In determining the amount of the penalty, the Upper Tribunal must have regard to the amount of unpaid tax, or amount unpaid in respect of a tax credit. The penalty must be imposed within 12 months of the later of: 
 
 the date of the initial £300 penalty notice 
 the end of the period in which an appeal against the information notice could have been made (but was not), or 
 the date on which an appeal against the information notice is determined or withdrawn 
 
 The taxpayer is not liable to either the £300 fixed penalty or the ‘up to’ £60 daily penalty if: 
 
 they satisfy the WRA or (on appeal) the tribunal that there is a reasonable excuse for either their failure to comply or obstruction, or 
 they fail to do something they are required to do within a limited period of time (such as a requirement in an information notice to produce documents by a specified time), but they did it within such further time as the WRA may have allowed 
 
 The WRA must make an assessment and notify the taxpayer of their liability to either penalty (the £300 fixed penalty and the ‘up to’ £60 daily penalty) within 12 months of the date on which they first became liable to the penalty. 
 The taxpayer must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the WRA issued the notice of the penalty assessment, unless: 
 
 the taxpayer gives a notice of review against the penalty, in which case they must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the review is concluded and the decision to award a penalty is upheld, or 
 the taxpayer gives a notice of appeal against the penalty, in which case they must pay the penalty no later than 30 days from the date on which the appeal is finally determined and the award of the penalty is upheld or the appeal is withdrawn 
 
 The WRA will charge interest on the amount of any unpaid penalty from the date following the date on which the penalty is due to be paid until it is paid.

685,685,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,"TCMA/3080 Penalties relating to inaccuracies, reasonable care and penalty suspension"," A person is liable to a penalty where, owing to a lack of reasonable care (careless behaviour) or deliberate behaviour, they give the WRA a document which contains an inaccuracy that leads to: 
 
 an understatement of a liability to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated statement of a loss relating to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated claim to repayment of devolved tax, or 
 a false or inflated claim for a tax credit 
 
 An inaccuracy is careless if it is due to the taxpayer failing to take reasonable care. In other words, if reasonable care was taken, an inaccuracy would be neither deliberate nor careless. 
 The amount of the penalty imposed depends on the behaviour exhibited by the taxpayer. Penalties are then calculated as a percentage of the potential lost revenue. TCMA allows the WRA to impose penalties not exceeding a certain amount. 
 The WRA will apply penalty ranges as summarised in the table below: 
 
 
 
 
 Type of behaviour 
 
 
 Unprompted disclosure 
 
 
 Prompted disclosure 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reasonable care taken

 15% to 30% 
 
 
 
 
 Deliberate 
 
 
 30% to 100% 
 
 
 50% to 100% 
 
 
 
 
 An inaccuracy which was neither deliberate nor careless on the part of the taxpayer when the document containing the inaccuracy was given to the WRA, is to be treated as being careless if the taxpayer discovered the inaccuracy at a later time and did not take reasonable steps to inform the WRA as soon as was practicable after the inaccuracy was discovered. 
 Reasonable care 
 ‘Reasonable care’ can simply be defined as the behaviour of a prudent and reasonable person in the position of the person in question. 
 This was suggested by Judge Berner in the First-Tier Tribunal decision in HMRC v David Collis, where it was noted: 
 
 That penalty applies if the inaccuracy in the relevant document is due to a failure on the part of the taxpayer (or other person giving the document) to take reasonable care. We consider that the standard by which this falls to be judged is that of a prudent and reasonable taxpayer in the position of the taxpayer in question. 
 
 The WRA recognises that people do make mistakes. In determining whether or not a person has failed to take reasonable care, the WRA will seek to establish whether the person has taken the care and attention that could be expected from a reasonable person taking reasonable care in similar circumstances. 
 For reasonable care to apply there must be no question, for example, about whether or not the person knew about an inaccuracy when they provided the information or document to the WRA or failed to comply with the relevant requirement. If the person did know about the inaccuracy when they provided the information to the WRA or failed to comply with the relevant requirement, that would be a deliberate inaccuracy or deliberate failure for the purposes of determining the penalty. 
 In determining whether or not the person failed to take reasonable care, the WRA will examine what the person did (or did not do), and will consider whether a prudent and reasonable person would have done (or not done) that in those circumstances. Although the WRA expects every person to take reasonable care, the WRA cannot determine whether or not they have done so without considering the person’s abilities and circumstances. 
 For example, the WRA would not ordinarily expect the same level of knowledge or expertise from a self-employed, un-represented individual as from a large multinational company. Large or complex issues would also require a greater level of care to arrive at the correct tax position. Importantly then, the WRA expects taxpayers to take appropriate professional advice where necessary – failure to do so where the transaction clearly required it would be a failure to take reasonable care. 
 Repeated inaccuracies or failures to comply may, for example, form part of a pattern of behaviour which suggests a lack of care by the person in developing adequate systems for the recording of transactions or preparing tax returns. If the person becomes aware of the causes of an inaccuracy or failure but after this nevertheless repeats the inaccuracy or failure, this may indicate deliberate behaviour on the part of the person in relation to those repetitions. 
 Examples of when a penalty might not be due (because a person did take reasonable care) include: 
 
 a reasonably arguable view that is subsequently not upheld 
 an arithmetical or transposition inaccuracy that is not so large either in absolute terms or relative to a person’s overall tax liability, as to produce an obviously odd result or be picked up by a “sense” check 
 a person taking action which leads to the inaccuracy or failure following advice from the WRA that later proves to be wrong, provided that all the details and circumstances were given by the person to the WRA when the advice was sought 
 a person acting on advice from a competent adviser which proves to be wrong despite the adviser being given a full set of the accurate facts, and 
 a person accepting and using information from another person whose competence the taxpayer could reasonably expect to rely on but where it is not possible to check that the information is accurate and complete 
 
 Suspending the penalty 
 The WRA may, subject to one or more conditions, suspend all or part of the penalty for a  careless  inaccuracy. 
 A careless inaccuracy penalty may only be suspended if compliance with a condition of the suspension will help a person avoid becoming liable to any further penalties.  
 A penalty for a deliberate inaccuracy cannot be suspended. 
 If the WRA decides that a suspension is justifiable, a notice must be issued to the taxpayer specifying: 
 
 what part of the penalty is to be suspended 
 the period of suspension (which cannot exceed 2 years), and 
 the condition(s) of suspension which the taxpayer must comply with. 
 
 A condition of suspension may specify an action to be taken, and the period within which that action may be taken. WRA will set SMART conditions when suspending a penalty.  SMART  conditions are: 
 
 Specific  – directly related to the business or individual. 
 Measurable  – the taxpayer will need to be able to ‘evidence’ that the condition has been met at end of the suspension period. 
 Achievable  – it must be in the taxpayer’s power to meet the condition. 
 Realistic  – Conditions cannot be unreasonable (for example, it would not be reasonable to require a small one-man business to employ a full-time bookkeeper, conditions must be economically realistic). 
 Time bound  – there must be a clear date by which the condition(s) must be met. 
 
 On the expiry of the period of suspension, the suspended penalty (or part of the penalty that was suspended) is cancelled if the taxpayer satisfies the WRA that they have complied with the suspension conditions. 
 If the WRA is not satisfied that the taxpayer has complied with the suspension conditions, the suspended penalty (or part of the penalty that was suspended) becomes payable. This will include any interest on the penalty that would have otherwise been chargeable but for the suspension. 
 If, during the period of suspension, you become liable to another penalty for providing a document to the WRA containing a careless or a deliberate inaccuracy, the suspended penalty (or the part of the penalty that was suspended) becomes payable, together with any interest on the penalty that would have otherwise been chargeable but for the suspension.

686,686,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3090 Determining and calculating the penalty amount," Penalties fall into 2 broad categories: those set at a fixed amount, and those where the amount may vary (usually up to a certain limit). 
 The WRA will calculate the penalty amount, normally by applying the penalty at the upper limit of each penalty range and then determining whether a reduction may be available in view of the particular circumstances and facts of the case. 
 The WRA may reduce the amount of the penalty: 
 
 because of special circumstances, or 
 if the taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA 
 
 Calculating the potential lost revenue 
 Normal rule 
 The normal rule for potential lost revenue (‘PLR’) is that it is the additional amount payable to the WRA as a result of: 
 
 correcting an inaccuracy in a document, including an inaccuracy attributable to another person 
 failing to tell the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment 
 an inaccurate repayment or credit having been made by the WRA as a result of the inaccuracy, or 
 a repayment or credit that would have been incorrectly made by the WRA if the inaccuracy had not been corrected 
 
 When determining the PLR for the purposes of calculating the amount of a penalty, the PLR itself may be subject to recovery or retention by a procedure such as a WRA assessment or the WRA formally refusing a claim. 
 An inaccuracy can affect the tax due in more than one tax period. The additional amount of tax due as a result of putting right an inaccuracy includes any tax effect from that inaccuracy that arises in later or earlier tax periods. 
 Inaccuracies in other documents that have been given to the WRA for the same transaction or period will be considered separately in terms of calculating penalty amounts.

 John purchases a house and submits an LTT return for the transaction, the result of which is that John pays £5,000 in LTT. Following a compliance check it was agreed that John had made a careless inaccuracy in completing the LTT return. As a result of correcting the inaccuracy, John’s LTT liability is now £8,000. 
 The PLR is £3,000 (£8,000 – £5,000).

As a result of correcting the inaccuracy, Sarah’s claim is reduced to £1,400.

 Potential lost revenue: multiple errors 
 If the taxpayer is liable to more than one penalty under section 129 TCMA in respect of more than one inaccuracy in the same document, the order in which the inaccuracies are corrected may affect the amount of PLR. Where this is the case, careless inaccuracies are to be taken to be corrected before deliberate inaccuracies. 
 If the taxpayer is liable to a penalty under section 129 TCMA in respect of one or more understatements in one or more documents relating to a tax period or transaction, in calculating the PLR the WRA will take account of any overstatement in any document the taxpayer has given us in relation to the same tax period or transaction. 
 Where this is the case, overstatements are to be set against understatements in the following order: 
 
 understatements in relation to which the taxpayer is not liable to a penalty 
 careless understatements, and 
 deliberate understatements 
 
 ‘Understatement’ in this case means an inaccuracy that amounts to, or leads to: 
 
 an understatement of a liability to a devolved tax 
 a false or inflated statement of a loss relating to a devolved tax, or 
 a false or inflated claim to repayment of devolved tax 
 
 ‘Overstatement’ in this case means an inaccuracy which is not an understatement. In other words, it is an inaccuracy which does not amount to, or lead to, any of the above results. 
 If the overall effect of the overstatements and understatements is that the tax liability is overstated when the document was submitted, there will be no PLR. 
 In calculating PLR for the purposes of a penalty under section 129 TCMA, no account is to be taken of the fact that a PLR from the taxpayer (the person who gave the WRA the document containing the inaccuracy) is or may be balanced by a potential overpayment by another person (except to the extent that legislation requires or permits another person’s tax liability to be adjusted by reference to the taxpayer’s tax liability). 
 Inaccuracies in other documents that have been given to the WRA for the same transaction or period will be considered separately in terms of calculating penalty amounts. 
 Potential lost revenue: losses 
 
 Where an inaccuracy has the result that a loss is wrongly recorded for the purposes of a devolved tax, and the loss has been wholly used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer, the PLR is calculated in accordance with the ‘normal rule’ (see the first sub-heading in this section, ‘Potential lost revenue: Normal rule’). 
 Where an inaccuracy has the result that a loss is wrongly recorded for the purposes of a devolved tax, and either all or part of the wrongly recorded loss has not yet been used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer (and so the tax effect is not yet known), the PLR is:
	 
 calculated in accordance with the ‘normal rule’ (see the first sub=heading in this section, ‘Potential lost revenue: Normal rule’) in respect of any part of the loss (if any) that has been used to reduce the amount of tax which is due and payable by the taxpayer, plus 
 a discounted rate of 10% (the discounted rate) of the unused loss. The discounted rate recognises uncertainty about the current tax value of the loss when it is eventually used to reduce the taxpayer’s tax liability. 
 
 
 
 Both of the above rules 1 and 2 (a loss being wholly or not wholly used to reduce the amount of tax due and payable) apply both to: 
 
 a case where no loss would have been recorded but for the inaccuracy, and 
 to a case where a loss of a different amount would have been recorded – in this case, both of the above rules apply only to the difference between the amount recorded and the true amount. 
 
 Finally, the PLR in respect of a loss in any case is nil where, because of either the nature of the loss or the taxpayer’s circumstances, there is no reasonable prospect of the loss being used in the future to support a claim to reduce the tax liability of any person. 
 Whether or not there is a reasonable prospect of any such loss being used depends on the nature of the loss and the taxpayer’s circumstances. In determining whether or not there is a reasonable prospect, the WRA will consider if there is a legal or factual reason which means that the loss can never be used. If the answer to this is ‘yes’, then the PLR for that loss is nil. 
 Potential lost revenue: delayed tax 
 Where an inaccuracy (a ‘delayed tax inaccuracy’) results in an amount of tax (‘the delayed tax’) being declared to the WRA later than it should have been, the PLR is: 
 
 5% of the delayed tax for each year of the delay, or 
 a percentage of the delayed tax, for each separate period of delay of less than a year, equating to 5% per year 
 
 This rule (the ‘delayed tax rule’) applies instead of the normal rules for calculating the PLR, but it does not apply to a case which falls under the ‘Potential lost revenue: losses’ heading above (i.e. a wrongly recorded loss). 
 The delayed tax rule covers cases where the delayed tax inaccuracy only has a timing effect so that, comparing an earlier period with a later one, there is no overall loss of tax (assuming the same rate of tax applies to both periods). The rule also covers situations where an over-claim in one period is matched by an under-claim in a later period. 
 In other words, for the delayed tax rule to apply a delayed tax inaccuracy always has two elements in different tax periods (one understatement and one overstatement) - even if a return for one period (that would contain the overstatement) is not yet due to be filed. Both elements of the delayed tax inaccuracy fall under the delayed tax rule, so the multiple inaccuracy rules (see the previous heading) do not apply to either the understatement or overstatement element of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 If the later return has not yet been filed, the WRA needs to decide whether the reversal would have taken place without the taxpayer doing anything if the inaccuracy had not been discovered. If the WRA is satisfied that it would have been automatically corrected (for example by the taxpayer’s accounting system) then the delayed tax rule applies. 
 
 
 
 
 Example - understatement in one return followed by overstatement in later return  
 
 
   
 Company A had an accounting system problem which resulted in a landfill invoice dated 10 June 2018 being incorrectly allocated to its second quarterly return (covering the 01/07/18 to 30/09/18 period) rather than the return covering the first quarterly period (01/04/18 to 30/06/18) period. As a result of the accounting problem, £10,000 of LDT was omitted from the first quarterly return and included instead on the second quarterly return without Company A taking any remedial action. 
 During a compliance check in November 2018, the WRA discovers the £10,000 omitted from the first quarterly return and included in the 2nd quarterly return. Company A accepts that it had failed to take reasonable care by not maintaining an adequate accounting system. 
 LDT of £10,000 has been declared later than it should have been. The inaccuracy was reversed in a later return without Company A having to do anything. The WRA is satisfied that the inaccuracy has both an understatement and an overstatement and is therefore a delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is therefore calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £10,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example - claim made prematurely  
 
 
   
 Company B, a landfill site operator, claimed £3,000 credit for LDT in its tax return for the quarterly return period 01/07/19 to 30/09/19, when it should have claimed it in its return for the following quarterly period 01/10/19 to 31/12/19. 
 During compliance checks in November 2019, the WRA discover this careless inaccuracy in Company B’s quarterly return. At this point the following quarterly return is not yet due. 
 In the WRA’s view, Company B’s accounting systems would not have claimed the amount of credit again in the following quarterly return, so the PLR for the penalty is calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £3,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £37.50

As a result of the accounting problem, £10,000 of LDT was omitted from the first quarterly return and included instead on the second quarterly return without Company A taking any remedial action. 
 During a compliance check in November 2018, the WRA discovers the £10,000 omitted from the first quarterly return and included in the 2nd quarterly return. Company A accepts that it had failed to take reasonable care by not maintaining an adequate accounting system. 
 LDT of £10,000 has been declared later than it should have been. The inaccuracy was reversed in a later return without Company A having to do anything. The WRA is satisfied that the inaccuracy has both an understatement and an overstatement and is therefore a delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is therefore calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy. 
 The PLR is: £10,000 x 5% x 3/12 = £125 
 
 Example - claim made prematurely  
 
 
   
 Company B, a landfill site operator, claimed £3,000 credit for LDT in its tax return for the quarterly return period 01/07/19 to 30/09/19, when it should have claimed it in its return for the following quarterly period 01/10/19 to 31/12/19. 
 During compliance checks in November 2019, the WRA discover this careless inaccuracy in Company B’s quarterly return. At this point the following quarterly return is not yet due. 
 In the WRA’s view, Company B’s accounting systems would not have claimed the amount of credit again in the following quarterly return, so the PLR for the penalty is calculated using the delayed tax rules. The delay here is 3 months (the period between the filing dates for the 2 returns) so the PLR for the penalty is 3/12 of 5% of the delayed tax inaccuracy.

687,687,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3100 Reasonable excuse," The taxpayer can appeal against some penalties if they have a reasonable excuse, for example for their return or payment being late. 
 A reasonable excuse is something that stopped the taxpayer meeting a tax obligation that they took reasonable care to meet. 
 There is no statutory definition of a reasonable excuse: it is a matter to be considered in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. What is reasonable will differ from person to person depending on their particular circumstances and abilities. 
 The following categories are examples of things which the WRA may consider to be a reasonable excuse for a period of time, but as mentioned before it will ultimately depend on the individual circumstances of each case, which are likely to require many other factors to be taken into account: 
 
 bereavement – the death of a close relative or domestic partner around the time of the failure or obstruction 
 serious illness – if this affects the taxpayer or a close relative or domestic partner around the time of the failure or obstruction 
 an unexpected stay in hospital that prevented the taxpayer from dealing with their tax affairs 
 a loss of records through fire, flood or theft 
 an unexpected loss of key personnel 
 computer or software failure just before or while the taxpayer was preparing their online return 
 unexpected disruption to the WRA’s online services 
 postal delays that the taxpayer couldn’t have predicted 
 delays related to a taxpayer’s disability 
 
 The following won’t be accepted as a reasonable excuse: 
 
 reliance on another person (unless the taxpayer took reasonable care to avoid the failure or obstruction) 
 a shortage of funds meaning the taxpayer is unable to pay what is due 
 the taxpayer made a mistake on their tax return 
 
 While a shortage of funds may not, on its own, be considered a reasonable excuse, the reason for the shortage of funds may be considered by WRA, where it was attributable to events outside the taxpayer’s control. In these circumstances, the WRA will consider whether the shortage of funds could have reasonably been avoided. 
 In addition, the WRA would not generally consider the following to be a reasonable excuse: 
 
 the tax return is too difficult to complete 
 pressure of work 
 lack of information 
 the fact that the WRA did not remind the taxpayer about something 
 ignorance of the law, or 
 a combination of any of the above 
 
 The onus is on the taxpayer to satisfy the WRA that they had a reasonable excuse at the time of the failure or obstruction (whichever applies). It is important to appreciate that a reasonable excuse does not apply where the failure or obstruction was deliberate. 
 The taxpayer must comply with their obligations as soon as possible after their reasonable excuse is resolved. If they do not put right the action or inaction without unreasonable delay after the excuse has ended, they remain liable to the penalty. 
 The WRA will consider carefully both the point at which a reasonable excuse ends and the actions the taxpayer took after that time to put right the action/inaction, or otherwise remedy the failure. Each case must be dealt with on its own merits. 
 In terms of unreasonable delay, there is no statutory definition of ‘unreasonable’. Again, each case must be judged on its own merits in view of the taxpayer’s abilities and circumstances. 
 If the WRA decides not to accept the taxpayer’s excuse as reasonable and impose a penalty, they can request a review or appeal in relation to the WRA’s decision.

688,688,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3110 Special circumstances," The WRA may reduce the amount of any of the following penalties (including any interest in relation to the penalty) if it thinks it is right to do so because of special circumstances: 
 
 any penalty for failing to make a tax return 
 any penalty for failing to pay tax 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to WRA 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to WRA and which is attributable to a person other than the taxpayer 
 a penalty for failing to notify the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment of tax 
 
 The WRA may also decide, because of special circumstances, to apply any of the following actions in relation to these penalties (including any interest in relation to the penalty): 
 
 remitting the penalty entirely 
 suspend it, and 
 agreeing a compromise with the taxpayer in relation to proceedings for the penalty 
 
 Special circumstances do not include taxpayer’s ability to pay, on its own, or the fact that a potential loss of revenue to the WRA by the taxpayer is balanced by a potential over-payment to the WRA by someone else. 
 To be considered as special circumstances, the circumstances in question must apply to the taxpayer and must not be general circumstances that apply to many taxpayers by virtue of the penalty legislation. 
 Special circumstances are something that is not otherwise provided for in legislation. So, for example, they will not include: 
 
 matters that amount to a reasonable excuse or reasonable care, or 
 the usual factors - telling, helping and giving access - which the WRA takes into account when considering whether or not to reduce the amount of a penalty for quality of disclosure 
 
 Special circumstances are uncommon or exceptional circumstances that should be clearly recognisable as such and are completely separate from the other considerations mentioned above. 
 Special circumstances may include the fact that the WRA has agreed that a person may pay an amount of devolved tax in instalments over an agreed period, but this may not be decisive; WRA will weigh up the circumstances of each particular case and consider all relevant factors.

689,689,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3120 Reduction for disclosure," Qualifying disclosures 
 The WRA may reduce the amount of the following penalties if the taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA: 
 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to the WRA 
 a penalty for an inaccuracy in a taxpayer document given to the WRA and which is attributable to another person 
 a penalty for failing to notify the WRA about an under-determination or under-assessment of tax 
 
 A qualifying disclosure in relation to a penalty for an inaccuracy must go beyond the mere submission of a return. 
 A ‘qualifying disclosure’ (under section 139(2) TCMA) means disclosure of: 
 
 an inaccuracy 
 a supply of false information or withholding of information, or 
 a failure to disclose an under-assessment or under-determination 
 
 The taxpayer makes a qualifying disclosure to the WRA (under section 139(3) TCMA) by: 
 
 telling the WRA about it 
 giving the WRA reasonable help in quantifying the inaccuracy, the inaccuracy attributable to the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination, and 
 allowing the WRA to access the taxpayer’s records so the WRA can ensure that the inaccuracy, the inaccuracy attributable to the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination is fully corrected 
 
 Any reductions for a qualifying disclosure may reflect (under section 139(4) TCMA): 
 
 whether the disclosure of the relevant information was prompted or unprompted, and 
 the quality of the disclosure 
 
 Disclosure of relevant information is ‘unprompted’ if the taxpayer made it at a time when the taxpayer had no reason to believe that the WRA had discovered, or was about to discover, the inaccuracy, the supply of false information or withholding of information, or the under-assessment or under-determination. 
 Disclosure of relevant information which is not unprompted is otherwise ‘prompted’ (under section 139(5) TCMA). 
 In relation to disclosure, ‘quality’ includes the timing, nature and extent of the disclosure (section 139(6) TCMA). 
 The ‘Reductions’ heading further below sets out the different levels of reduction the WRA may make to a penalty amount, depending on the quality of the disclosure and whether it was prompted or unprompted. 
 Reductions 
 As mentioned above, the WRA may at its discretion reduce the amount of a penalty depending on the quality of the taxpayer’s disclosure and whether it was prompted or unprompted. The amount by which the WRA may reduce the penalty will vary on a case by case basis.  
 The quality of disclosure revolves around the 3 core elements: ‘telling, helping and giving access’. These determine where the penalty will fall within the penalty range.  
 For: 
 
 telling, the WRA may give up to 30% 
 helping, the WRA may give up to 40% 
 giving access to records, the WRA may give up to 30% 
 
 This adds up to 100% of the total possible reduction. 
 Examples 
 
 Telling the WRA about, or agreeing that there is something wrong and how and why it happened. 
 Telling the WRA about the extent of what is wrong as soon as the taxpayer knows about it. 
 Telling and helping the WRA by answering questions in full. 
 Helping the WRA to understand documents or information. 
 Helping the WRA by replying to letters quickly. 
 Helping the WRA by agreeing to attend any meetings, or visits at a mutually convenient time. 
 Helping the WRA by checking records to identify the extent of the inaccuracy. 
 Helping the WRA by using the taxpayer’s private records to identify sales or income not included in their tax return. 
 Giving access to documents the WRA has asked for without unnecessary delay. 
 Giving access to documents the WRA may not know about, as well as those that it asks to see. 
 
 There may be overlaps among the categories above. A single course of action may qualify for a reduction under more than one category. 
 
 
 
 
 Example - calculating the penalty percentage rate 
 
 
   
 The penalty percentage rate is determined by the penalty range and the reduction for the quality of disclosure. 
 For example, if the WRA found a careless inaccuracy in a tax return that the taxpayer did not tell it about before an enquiry began. When the WRA told the taxpayer about the inaccuracy, they agreed with the WRA. This was a prompted disclosure.  
 The penalty range for a careless inaccuracy with a prompted disclosure is 15% to 30% of the potential lost revenue. 
 The reduction for quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving) was 70%. 
 
 
 
 Circumstances 
 Calculation 
 
 
 
 
 To work out the penalty percentage rate, the WRA first calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum penalty percentages 
 30% minus 15% = 15% 
 
 
 The WRA then multiplies that figure by the reduction for quality of disclosure to arrive at the percentage reduction 
 15% x 70% = 10.5% 
 
 
 The WRA then deducts the percentage reduction from the maximum penalty percentage it can charge 
 30% minus 10.5% = 19.5% 
 
 
 This gives the penalty percentage rate 
 19.5%

691,691,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Penalties,TCMA/3140 More than one penalty chargeable," In some circumstances, more than one penalty may be due to the WRA where a taxpayer has failed to comply with the obligations of the devolved tax legislation. In such circumstances, the WRA will determine whether each penalty is applicable on its own merits according to the facts. However, in determining the penalty amount where the amount is not fixed, the WRA will also consider the aggregate result of the combined penalties to ensure they are proportionate to the taxpayer’s circumstances, behaviour, and the amount of tax understated (or lost via an inflated statement of losses, claim for repayment or tax credit). 
 
 
 
 
 Example 
 
 
   
 Company A has agreed an alternative weighing method with the WRA to calculate the weight of waste disposed of at its authorised landfill site. However, the company does not apply the alternative method in line with the agreement. This also leads to an incorrect tax return being filed for the period in question, as the wrong weight was used in calculating taxable disposals. The WRA becomes aware of the issue when it carries out an enquiry into the tax return for the quarter when the incorrect method was used. The inaccuracy arose from a failure to take reasonable care. 
 As a result, the company is liable both to a penalty not exceeding £500 under section 61 of the Landfill Disposals Tax Act 2017 (for failure to determine taxable weight properly), and to a penalty not exceeding 30% of the potential lost revenue under section 129 TCMA (for a careless inaccuracy in a return). 
 In cases such as this, in addition to considering whether penalties may be reduced on their own terms, WRA will also consider the effect of the combined penalties to ensure the overall result is proportionate to the circumstances and amount of devolved tax understated.

692,692,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9010 Introduction," The WRA needs to be able to check that the correct amounts of tax have been paid at the right time in order to carry out its general function, which is the collection and management of the devolved taxes. To do this it may need to: 
 
 issue information notices, gather information and examine documents, or 
 inspect premises and any equipment and documents held on those premises 
 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
693,693,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9020 Overview of information notices," The WRA may use the following types of information notice to require a person to provide information or a document: 
 
 Taxpayer notices 
 Third party notices 
 Unidentified third party notices 
 Identification notices 
 
 The WRA may also issue debtor contact notices, which are subject to different requirements and procedures. 
 The WRA may issue an information notice where the information or document requested is required for the purposes of checking a person’s “tax position” and it is reasonable to require the person to provide the information or document. 
 The WRA may either specify or describe the information or documents being sought. This means that the WRA might require a specific document (e.g. a particular contract document), documents of a particular kind, or documents which contain a particular kind of information (e.g. any document containing information relating to a particular transaction, or to a particular time period). 
 The concept of a person’s “tax position” is wide and includes the person‘s past, present and future liability to pay any devolved tax or associated penalties, interest and any other related amounts that have been paid (or may be payable) by the person. It also includes related amounts that may be payable to the person by the WRA. 
 It follows therefore, that an information notice can be used in relation to an ongoing enquiry into a tax return or claim or to help the WRA in making a determination or an assessment. Checking a person’s potential future liability is likely to be a rare occurrence but it may be relevant, for example, in relation to certain types of land transaction which are staged over a long period and in relation to which a tax return might be made before all the liability to tax arises. 
 In some circumstances, an information notice may only be issued with the approval of the tribunal. 
 There are a number of restrictions preventing the WRA from providing certain information or certain documents in particular circumstances. 
 Where an information notice is issued, the recipient must comply with it.

694,694,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9030 Taxpayer notices," The WRA may issue a taxpayer notice requiring the recipient of the notice (the taxpayer) to provide information or produce a document to the WRA. A taxpayer notice must be approved by the tribunal. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
695,695,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9040 Third party notices," The WRA may issue a third party notice requiring the recipient to provide information or produce a document in relation to another person (the taxpayer). The WRA may not issue a third party notice without the approval of the tribunal or agreement of the taxpayer. 
 A third party notice must name the taxpayer and a copy of it must be issued to the taxpayer, although the tribunal may disapply one or both of these requirements if it is satisfied that the WRA has grounds for believing that naming the taxpayer or issuing the taxpayer with a copy of the notice might seriously prejudice the assessment or collection of the tax. 
 A number of additional requirements apply in relation to a third party notice issued in respect of a group of undertakings or a partnership. 
 Groups of undertakings 
 Where a third party notice is issued to a person for the purpose of checking the tax position of a parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries: 
 
 the notice must state its purpose (in addition to meeting the other requirements relating to third party notices), and 
 the parent undertaking is considered as the “taxpayer” (for the purposes of agreeing to the notice and being sent a copy of it) 
 
 Partnerships 
 Where a third party notice is issued, for the purposes of checking the tax position of a partnership, to someone who is not one of the partners: 
 
 the notice must state its purpose (in addition to meeting the other requirements relating to third party notices) and give the partnership’s registered name (or name by which it is known), and 
 A copy of the notice must be issued to at least one of the partners 
 
 The tribunal may disapply any of these requirements if it is satisfied that the WRA has grounds for believing that complying with them might seriously prejudice the assessment of collection of the tax.

696,696,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9050 Tribunal approval of taxpayer notices and third party notices," The WRA may not issue a taxpayer notice without the approval of the tribunal. The WRA may not issue a third party notice without the agreement of the taxpayer or the approval of the tribunal. The test that the tribunal must apply when deciding whether to approve a taxpayer notice or third party notice will depend on whether the recipient has been told that the WRA will be applying for approval. 
 If the recipient has not been told that the WRA will be applying for tribunal approval, the tribunal must be satisfied that the requirements for the issue of the notice have been met; and that giving notice of the application might prejudice the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 If the recipient has been told that the WRA will be applying for tribunal approval, the tribunal must be satisfied that: the requirements for the issue of the respective notice have been met; the recipient of the notice has been told about the information or documents required by the WRA; and the recipient has been given an opportunity to make representations about that request to the WRA. Where representations are made, the WRA must provide the tribunal with details of those representations. In the case of a third party notice, the tribunal must be satisfied that the taxpayer who is the subject of the notice, has been told by the WRA why the information or documents are required. 
 When a recipient has been told that the WRA is going to require the information or documents in a formal notice, it is a criminal offence under section 115 TCMA if a person conceals, destroys or otherwise disposes of the information or documents. 
 The tribunal may disapply some of the above requirements where giving notice of the application to the taxpayer or third party might prejudice the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 The tribunal may make such modifications of the notice as it thinks appropriate (for example the tribunal might think it is reasonable for the WRA to require some documents but not others and might restrict the scope of the information notice accordingly). 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
697,697,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9060 Unidentified third party notices," The WRA may, with the approval of the tribunal, issue an unidentified third party notice, requiring a person (the recipient) to provide information or produce a document relating to the tax position of a person whose identify it does not know or a class of persons whose individual identities it does not know. 
 In order to approve an unidentified third party notice, the tribunal must be satisfied that the WRA is not able to obtain the information or documents from another source. The tribunal must also be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person or persons who are the subject of the notice have failed (or may fail) to comply with the law related to a devolved tax and this has led (or will lead) to serious prejudice to the assessment or collection of devolved tax (for example, the WRA might have grounds to believe that the person involved in the land transaction is not going to come forward and make a tax return). The tribunal may make such modifications of the notice as it thinks appropriate. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
698,698,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9070 Identification notices," The WRA may, with the tribunal’s approval, issue an identification notice to someone requiring them to provide limited information about a person (either a single person or class of persons), namely the person’s name, last known address and date of birth, in order to establish a taxpayer’s identity. The WRA can issue an identification notice where it has grounds for believing that the recipient will be able to ascertain the identity of the taxpayer (from information held by WRA) and that the recipient obtained relevant information about the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business. 
 While an identification notice is similar to an unidentified third party notice, the information that may be required is much more limited and the WRA does not have to prove that there are grounds to believe that the unidentified person may have failed to comply with the law relating to devolved tax. In practice this procedure is likely to be used where the WRA knows that something has happened which attracts a tax liability (e.g. a land transaction) and wishes to contact the persons involved but does not know their identity. They may seek to use this power prior to the point where any failure to comply with the law occurs so that they are able to contact the taxpayer to give him or her the opportunity to get their tax affairs in order. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
699,699,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9080 Debtor contact notice," The WRA may issue a notice (debtor contact notice) requiring a person to provide contact details (a person’s address and any other contact information) for another person if it needs to contact a person who owes the WRA money but who the WRA has been unable to get hold of. This procedure can only be used if the contact details have been obtained by a person in the course of business, but cannot be used to ask for information from charities or persons providing services to charities free of charge.

700,700,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9090 Time limit for issuing a tribunal approved information notice," Where the tribunal approves an information notice, the WRA must issue it within 3 months of that approval, or a shorter period if specified by the tribunal. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
701,701,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9100 Complying with an information notice," The recipient of an information notice must comply with it and provide the required information or documents within a time period, location (which cannot be a place solely used as a dwelling) and in the manner specified in the information notice. The duty to comply with the information notice is suspended where the recipient has requested a review of the notice or made an appeal against it. A person who does not comply with an information notice may be liable to a penalty. 
 Where an information notice requires the person to produce a document, the person may comply by producing a copy of the original document (unless the notice specifically requests the original, or within 6 months of the copy being produced the WRA subsequently requests it). 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
702,702,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9110 General restrictions," An information notice may not require a person to produce a document if the whole of it originates more than 6 years before the date of the notice, unless the notice is issued with the approval of the tribunal. An information notice issued to check the tax position of someone who has died cannot be given more than 4 years after the death. A person is only required to produce a document if it is in their possession or power. 
 An information notice may not require a person to provide information or a document (part or full) where it relates to an ongoing review or appeal in relation to any tax (whether or not the tax is a “devolved tax”). For example, if HMRC is conducting an enquiry into a person’s self-assessment income tax return, the WRA cannot require information in relation to the same person’s devolved tax position if the information also relates to HMRC’s enquiry. 
 The WRA cannot require a person to provide material created, acquired or otherwise in someone’s possession for the purposes of journalism. Nor may WRA require a person to provide personal records or personal information contained in records, such as medical records. 
 The WRA may not issue a taxpayer notice in relation to a transaction or an accounting period (to check the tax position for those) where a person has made a tax return in relation to that transaction or accounting period. If the WRA wishes to check the tax position in relation to the tax return it should open an enquiry into the return. However, a taxpayer notice could be given where a notice of enquiry had been given and the enquiry was not completed (in other words the notice is part of the conduct of the enquiry) or where the WRA suspected an issue with the assessed tax liability (including any reliefs) for the transaction or accounting period (in other words the notice is part of the work the WRA does in making a WRA determination or WRA assessment). 
 The WRA may not require a person to provide or produce information or documents that are legally privileged. This refers to information or documents that benefit from the confidentiality that arises between a professional legal adviser and a client. Where there is a dispute, it is for a tribunal to determine whether or not material is privileged. There are also restrictions on the information and documents that a tax adviser or auditor may be required to provide: generally, tax advisers are not required to provide communication between themselves and their client; and auditors are not required to provide information relating to their audit function.

703,703,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9120 Overview of inspection powers," The WRA may enter premises and carry out inspections of them and of business assets and documents on the premises, when they have grounds for believing that this is required for the purposes of checking a person’s tax position. The WRA has no power under these provisions to use force to gain access to premises, but if a person refuses to permit access to premises for an inspection, they may be liable to penalties. When exercising powers of inspection, the WRA official must produce evidence of their authority to do so, when asked to do so by the occupier or any other person who appears to be in charge of the premises. Failure to produce this evidence means that the inspection must stop. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
704,704,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9130 Power to inspect business premises," The WRA can enter premises (or part of a premises) that it considers are being used to carry on a business and inspect those premises (including assets and documents on them). It may do so where it has grounds for believing that the inspection is required for the purposes of checking a person‘s tax position. Such an inspection can only be carried out with either the agreement of the occupier of the premises or with the approval of the tribunal. 
 The WRA may undertake an inspection at any time it has agreed with the occupier or at a reasonable time if the inspection has been approved by the tribunal. If the WRA has not obtained the occupier’s agreement, it must give the occupier notice of the inspection 7 days before it is due to take place, unless the tribunal is satisfied that giving such notice would seriously prejudice tax collection or assessment. 
 The WRA may not be permitted to enter or inspect any part of premises that are used solely as a dwelling. 
 In order to check a person’s tax position in relation to Landfill Disposals Tax, the WRA may enter the business premises of a third person if WRA has grounds for believing that person is or has been involved in any capacity with the disposal of material that may be subject to LDT (either at an authorised landfill site or elsewhere). 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
705,705,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9140 Carrying out inspections," When carrying out an inspection, the WRA has a number of powers, including: taking any other person(s) with them onto the premises (including a police officer where it is believed that the inspection may be seriously obstructed); examining or investigating anything considered necessary in the circumstances of the inspection; directing that the premises (or any part of the premises) be left undisturbed for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of any examination or investigation; the power to take samples of materials from the premises, including by experimental borings or other works or the installation and maintenance of monitoring or other apparatus on the premises; and marking assets to show that they have been inspected. 
 The WRA may not inspect any documents that it would not be able to require through an information notice (for example, a document containing legally privileged material). 
 The WRA may, with the agreement of the occupier, also take equipment or materials required for the inspection on to the business premises. The WRA may take such equipment or material without the occupier’s agreement, either on service of a notice on the occupier (7 days in advance) or, if serving such a notice would seriously prejudice the assessment or collection of tax, without giving notice.

706,706,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9150 Power to inspect premises or property for valuation," The WRA may enter and inspect premises (including dwellings) and any property on the premises for the purpose of valuing, measuring or determining the character of the premises if it is required for the purposes of checking a person‘s tax position. 
 Such an inspection can only be carried out with either the agreement of the occupier (or a person who is in charge of the premises if the occupier cannot be identified), or the approval of the tribunal, (provided the occupier or person in charge has been given at least 7 days notice of the inspection).  
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
707,707,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9160 Approval of tribunal for inspection of premises," Where the occupier of the premises does not agree to allowing an inspection (or does not agree to the WRA exercising all of its powers during an inspection), the WRA can ask the tribunal to approve an inspection and exercise of the related powers. 
 The application to the tribunal can be made without notice and in such circumstances the tribunal must satisfy itself that the sending of a notice of the application might have prejudiced the assessment or collection of devolved tax. 
 In approving an inspection the tribunal must be satisfied that the inspection is required for the purposes of checking a person’s tax position. 
 In approving an inspection for valuation purposes, the tribunal has to be satisfied that the WRA gave both the person whose tax position is being checked and the occupier (if different and capable of being identified) a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the WRA and the WRA must give a summary of any representations to the tribunal. 
 The WRA has to carry out an inspection no later than 3 months after the tribunal’s approval or within any shorter period as specified by the tribunal. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
708,708,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9170 Further investigatory powers," When inspecting premises, the WRA may copy, make extracts from, remove and retain a document for a reasonable period of time. Where it does so, and the person who produced the document so requests, the WRA must (at no charge to the person) provide a copy of the document and a receipt for it and a copy of it. 
 The WRA may access information or documents stored in electronic form and may inspect and check the operation of any computer or associated apparatus or material relevant to the document or information. 
 Any person obstructing the WRA or an inspector exercising the powers in subsections (3) and (5) is liable to a penalty under section 146. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-investigative-powers-technical-guidance
709,709,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Investigative powers,TCMA/9180 Offences relating to information notices," It is an offence to conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of a document required by an information notice which has been approved by the tribunal (even if the person has appealed against the information notice or a requirement in it). 
 It is also an offence to conceal, destroy or otherwise dispose of a document where the WRA has told a person that it intends to seek the tribunal’s agreement, but has not yet done so. 
 It is a defence where a person demonstrates that there was a reasonable excuse. A person who commits an offence under either of the sections is liable on summary conviction to a fine or on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to 2 years or to a fine (or both). In each case the court has discretion as to the amount of the fine.

710,710,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Interest,TCMA/4010 Late payment interest," The WRA will charge interest on any amount of unpaid tax, commencing from the late payment interest start date and ending on the date it is paid.  
 The late payment interest start date for particular amounts of tax is stated in the following table: 
 
 
 
 Amount of tax unpaid 
 Late payment interest start date 
 
 
 
 
 Amount stated in a tax return 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a return amended by the taxpayer (s41 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA correction notice (s42 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in an amendment to a return made by the WRA (s45 or s50 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA assessment (s54 or s55 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date for the tax return 
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA determination (s52 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date when the return was required to be made 
			  
 
 
 Amount stated in a WRA assessment where no tax return (s54 or s55 TCMA) 
 Day after the filing date when the return was required to be made 
			  
 
 
 
 The late payment interest start date may be a non-business day. The date of payment includes the date on which the amount is set off against another amount payable by the WRA. 
 The interest charged is simple interest, not compound interest. This means that late payment interest is only calculated on the amount of unpaid tax and not on late payment interest that has already been charged or accrued. The Tax Collection and Management (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018 set out the late payment interest rates. The percentage per annum interest rate charged for late payment of tax is the Bank of England rate +2.5%. 
 When an amount is paid to the WRA, it must issue a receipt if requested. 
 If a taxpayer dies before an amount becomes due and payable, and the executor of the deceased taxpayer is unable to pay the amount before obtaining probate or letters of administration, the late payment interest start date is the later of: 
 
 the date the late payment interest would have started if the taxpayer had not died, and 
 the day after the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the grant of probate or letters of administration.

711,711,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Interest,TCMA/4020 Late payment interest on penalties," The WRA will charge interest on an amount of unpaid penalty from the date on which the penalty was due to be paid until is the day it is paid (this includes non-business days. See TCMA/3040 for more information on penalty due dates. 
 ‘Unpaid penalty’ means a penalty which has not been paid in full by the due date. 
 The percentage per annum interest rate charged for late payment of a penalty is the percentage per annum figure of the Bank of England rate + 2.5%. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-interest-technical-guidance
712,712,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Interest,TCMA/4030 Repayment interest," The WRA will pay interest on any repayment of: 
 
 tax 
 penalties, and 
 interest (which the taxpayer may have had to previously pay on the tax or penalties). 
 
 In all cases, any repayment must relate to amount of devolved taxes or penalties; the WRA will not repay any amounts that were paid to the WRA in error. 
 Repayment interest starts on: 
 
 the date that the payment was made by the taxpayer, or 
 the date on which the amount became payable to WRA 
 
 whichever is later. 
 The start date may be a non-business day. 
 Repayment interest ends on the date the repayment is made by the WRA. 
 The Tax Collection and Management (Administration) (Wales) Regulations 2018 set out the late repayment interest rates. The percentage interest rate applied is the higher of: 
 
 0.5% per annum, or 
 the Bank of England rate. 
 
 The interest paid is simple interest, not compound interest. This means that repayment interest is only calculated on the amount of tax, penalties or interest (on tax or penalties) which is being repaid, and not on repayment interest that has already been accrued.

713,713,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6010 Introduction," Most people will pay the WRA any money due (whether on tax, penalties or interest) on time. Some people, however, are either not able to pay the sum of money on time or will choose not to pay it upon demand. 
 It is important that the taxpayer makes the WRA aware as soon as possible about any difficulties they may have, or expect to have, in paying any money they owe. Where appropriate, and considering each case on an individual basis, the WRA will then seek to work together with the taxpayer to find a payment arrangement which is acceptable both to both parties. 
 There will however be cases where, given the circumstances, the WRA does not consider it possible or appropriate to enter into such arrangements. In such cases, and where the taxpayer has failed to respond to a demand for payment, the WRA may undertake enforcement action to recover the debt. 
 If a person owes us money but we do not have their contact details, in certain circumstances we can give a notice requiring a third party to provide us with those contact details. 
 This guidance only covers civil debt recovery and does not deal with recovery measures following criminal proceedings, such as those provided for under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-debt-recovery-technical-guidance
714,714,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6020 Contract settlements," If the taxpayer has, or expects to have, difficulties in paying any money owed (such as following the end of an enquiry or investigation), where appropriate (and considering each case on an individual basis) the WRA will seek to work together with the taxpayer to find a payment arrangement which is acceptable to both parties. This is in line with the WRA’s commitment to treat all taxpayers fairly and collect the devolved taxes properly and efficiently.  
 One option is a contract settlement. A contract settlement is a legally binding agreement between the taxpayer and the WRA over the taxpayer’s liability to pay a sum of money to the WRA in relation to the devolved taxes. It is not to be confused with a settlement agreement which is a specific agreement reached between the taxpayer and the WRA in relation to a dispute. 
 The WRA has a degree of discretion in arranging the form a specific contract agreement takes, but this is dependent on the specific circumstances of the case.

715,715,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6030 Debt recovery," If the WRA issues a demand to pay a sum of money owed (whether tax, penalties, interest or a combination of any of these) and, following the demand, the taxpayer has still not paid that sum, the WRA may undertake enforcement action to recover the debt. 
 The WRA has a range of powers to secure recovery of debt. These include: 
 
 In cases where an outstanding amount (up to £2000) of tax, penalties or interest has not been paid, the WRA may initiate civil proceedings in magistrates’ court to recover the debt. These proceedings must normally be instigated within 12 months of the day following the date on which the tax, penalty or interest should have been paid. 
 Enforcement by taking control of goods, using the procedure in Schedule 12 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c. 15) (taking control of goods). 
 Initiating civil or criminal proceedings, including County Court and High Court.

716,716,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6040 Certification of debt," The WRA may issue a certificate of debt if a taxpayer has failed to pay tax, penalties or interest. A certificate by the WRA (or any document purporting to be such a certificate) is sufficient evidence of that fact until the contrary is proved. The purpose of such a certificate is to provide evidence to the court in support of any debt or action which we administer, avoiding the need for lengthy documentation.

717,717,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Debt recovery,TCMA/6050 Debtor contact notice," In certain circumstances, the WRA has the power to give a notice to a third party requiring them to provide the WRA with the contact details of a person who owes money to the WRA (section 93 TCMA). 
 ‘Contact details’ means the debtor’s address and any other information about how the debtor can be contacted. 
 This is not a power which is used to simply find out more about a taxpayer. Other powers are available to the WRA for carrying out more detailed investigations on a person’s tax position, such as powers of enquiry, information notices, and inspection. 
 The WRA may only issue a debtor contact notice where: 
 
 the WRA reasonably requires the contact details in order to collect the sum of money owed 
 the WRA has reasonable grounds for believing that the third party has the required contact details, and 
 
 either: 
 
 the third party is a company or unincorporated association, or 
 the WRA has reasonable grounds to believe that the third party obtained the details in the course of carrying on a business. 
 
 ‘Carrying on a business’ includes: 
 
 carrying on any activity for the purposes of generating income from land (wherever situated) 
 carrying on a profession 
 the activities of a charity, and 
 the activities of a local authority or any other public authority. 
 
 The WRA cannot issue a debtor contact notice to a third party which: 
 
 is a charity and obtained the contact details in the course of providing services free of charge, or 
 is not a charity but obtained the contact details in the course of providing services on behalf of a charity that are free of charge to the recipient of the service. 
 
 Complying with the notice 
 The notice issued by the WRA to the third party must name the debtor and specify or describe the period, means and form in which the contact details must be provided. A third party who fails to comply with the notice in any respect is liable to a penalty. A third party can seek a review or appeal against the giving of such a notice (or any requirement in it) only in specific circumstances.

WRA may only use information it has acquired in connection with its functions (subject to any international obligations of the UK that restricts or prohibits the use of information). 
 Protected taxpayer information (‘PTI’) is information the WRA has (or any person to which the WRA has delegated its functions), which could lead to that person being identified. Information is not ‘PTI’ if it is information about internal administrative arrangements of the WRA or in relation to a member of WRA staff.

 an individual who is (or was) a member of WRA staff, or a member of a WRA committee or sub-committee 
 an individual who is (or was) exercising functions or providing services on behalf of WRA. This would also include anyone who provides services to any individual to which WRA has delegated functions. 
 
 The general rule is that PTI must not be disclosed. 
 A relevant official may, however, disclose PTI where specifically permitted by law to do so.

 It is permitted: 
 
 with the consent of each person to whom the information relates 
 for the purposes of obtaining services in connection with a function of WRA. This includes contracts and shared service agreements entered into between WRA and other public sector bodies or private sector providers 
 for the purposes of criminal investigations or criminal proceedings or for the purposes of the prevention or detection of crime

Alternatively, they could claim that the information disclosed had already been lawfully made public. However, the person charged with the offence has the responsibility for proving this.

724,724,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5000 Our approach to tax disputes," Our approach to tax disputes sets out how we will manage disputes with taxpayers. 
 A dispute arises where a taxpayer disagrees with a WRA decision. And intends to challenge it using their statutory rights to a review or appeal to the tribunal. 
 The objectives of our strategy  
 At the heart of our approach there are 5 key objectives:  
 
 Ensure the fairness of the Welsh tax system.  
 Ensure the right amount of tax is paid. 
 Resolve disputes in a cost-effective way.  
 Protect and test the legislation.  
 Influence customer behaviour.  
 
 How we’ll deliver these objectives  
 We want to minimise the risk of a dispute arising in the first instance. This means that our dispute strategy doesn’t begin when we issue an appealable decision. It begins at the start of a taxpayers’ interaction with us. 
 We will minimise the risk of a dispute arising by: 
 
 tailoring our approach to taxpayers 
 maximising opportunities to communicate with taxpayers clearly and in their preferred language 
 communicating throughout our engagement with a taxpayer 
 explaining our decisions clearly and in full 
 
 Sometimes, the taxpayer will choose to disagree with a decision and seek to challenge it. We will act quickly to resolve the dispute: 
 
 we will agree with a taxpayer what is not in dispute (such as facts or interpretation of the law) 
 we will continue to communicate throughout the dispute 
 
 Wherever possible we will settle cases by agreement. But we need to recognise this isn’t always possible. There will be times where we need to litigate to protect our position. 
 Once a dispute has closed, we will learn from it. 
 What this means for taxpayers 
 
 We’ll invest more time up front to prevent disputes. 
 We’ll seek to settle issues by agreement wherever possible. 
 We’ll never “split the difference”. 
 We’ll treat each individual issue on its merits. So, we won’t decide not to pursue one dispute if a taxpayer settles another. 
 We might litigate a dispute, even where there is a small amount of tax at stake. 
 We’ll take a hard line on evasion/ avoidance. We’ll reach agreement wherever possible but will not shy away from litigation to ensure Welsh taxes are applied in the way intended by the Welsh Parliament. 
 We’ll consider alternative dispute resolution to settle disputes where appropriate and cost-effective.

The review will be carried out by a member of WRA staff who has not previously been involved in the matter. During the review, the WRA may want to contact the taxpayer to verify or clarify information as part of the review process. 
 The WRA must ensure it has a reasonable opportunity to consider any representations made by the person requesting the review. 
 In concluding the review, the WRA can affirm, vary or cancel the original decision which was under review. 
 The outcome of the review must be communicated to the person who requested it within 45 days of the WRA receiving the notice of request. It is possible to change the time period on the condition that the WRA and the person requesting the review both agree to the revised timing.

 If the WRA does not notify the person within 45 days, the review will be deemed to have concluded that the WRA’s decision is to be upheld. The WRA must notify the person who issued the notice of request that this is the outcome of the review.

736,736,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5120 Payment and recovery of tax subject to review or appeal," If a person has requested a review into a decision or appealed against a decision, this does not affect any requirement on them to pay an amount of devolved tax (or, in the case of LDT, an amount of tax credit). 
 Postponement requests 
 If a person has requested a review or made an appeal against a WRA decision and they believe they have been charged an excessive amount of tax as a consequence of that decision, they may apply to the WRA for the recovery of the tax (and interest on that amount) to be postponed (‘a postponement request’). 
 This guidance summarises the key aspects of applying for a postponement request, but you may need to refer to the full legislative provisions at sections 181A-181J of the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016 if this topic is relevant to you. 
 Time for making postponement requests 
 Where a postponement request relates to a decision where a review has been or is being requested, the request must be made within the time allowed for requesting a review (this is often within 30 days of a decision being made but see TCMA/5040 for more information), or, if a late request for a review is made, the postponement request must be made at the same time. 
 Where a postponement request relates to a decision where an appeal has been or is being sought, the request must be made within the time allowed for requesting a review (this is often within 30 days of a decision being made or within 30 days of a WRA review conclusion being issued but see TCMA/5090 for more information), or, if the tribunal gives permission for a late appeal, the postponement request must be made at the same time as permission is sought. 
 Late postponement requests may also be considered by WRA if the person applying has a reasonable excuse for failing to make the request within the required timeframe and subsequently made the request without unreasonable delay. 
 Information that a postponement request should contain 
 When a postponement request is sent to WRA it must give the following information: 
 
 the amount of tax considered to be excessive 
 the reasons for believing the amount is excessive 
 
 When a postponement request relates to LDT, it also needs to specify the reasons why recovery of the amount (including any interest) would cause the person making the application financial hardship. 
 WRA must issue a notice of its decision on a postponement request to the person who made the request. 
 Granting a postponement request 
 WRA has the power to grant a postponement request if satisfied that the person has reasonable grounds for thinking the amount of devolved tax is excessive. In the case of an LDT postponement request, WRA will also need to have reason to believe that recovery would cause financial hardship. 
 WRA may grant a postponement request for part of an amount.  
 If approved, all or part of a postponement may be made conditional on the provision of additional security.  
 If a postponement request is not granted  
 If WRA does not grant a postponement request, this decision can be appealed to the Tribunal. The appeal must be made within 30 days of WRA issuing the decision. The Tribunal may affirm, cancel or replace WRA’s decision.  
 Varying a postponement decision 
 After a postponement request has been granted it may be varied if there is a change in circumstances. This could involve changing the amount of tax postponed or conditions attached to the postponement. Either WRA or the taxpayer may request a variation and it must be agreed by both parties. If agreed, the WRA will issue a notice to the taxpayer of this decision.  
 If agreement cannot be reached within 21 days of the request for a variation, the taxpayer or the WRA can apply to the Tribunal for a determination on the variation. The Tribunal can refuse or agree the variation or propose their own variation. 
 Recovery of tax during postponement period 
 Once a postponement request is granted, the WRA cannot seek to recover any postponed amount of tax during the postponement period. The postponement period will usually begin on the day on which the postponement request is made and end on the day on which the relevant review or appeal is concluded.  
 There may be scope for further postponement requests if further appeals are made to the Tribunal.

737,737,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5130 Consequences of reviews and appeals," Payment of penalties in the event of a review or appeal 
 Where the WRA carries out a review into an amount of penalty that is disputed by a taxpayer and the review concludes that the taxpayer is liable, the taxpayer has to pay the penalty within 30 days of the date the notice informing them of the outcome of the review was issued. 
 If the taxpayer appeals against the decision, but subsequently withdraws the appeal, they must pay the penalty within 30 days of the date of the withdrawal. 
 If the result of the appeal is that the taxpayer is liable, they must pay the penalty within 30 days of the date that the appeal was determined. 
 Disposal of reviews and appeals in respect of information notices 
 Where a review concludes that an information notice will be upheld or varied, the notice recipient must comply with the information notice within a time period to be determined by the WRA. 
 If the tribunal upholds or varies an information notice, the notice recipient must comply with the notice within a time period set by either the tribunal or the WRA. 
 Suspension of repayments pending further appeal 
 If the tribunal determines that an amount of tax needs to be repaid to the taxpayer following an appeal, the WRA may request permission from the tribunal to postpone repayment of the amount until a further appeal is determined or the WRA is able to obtain security for the amount. The tribunal must agree to the request if it gives permission for a further appeal, or if it thinks the postponement is needed to protect the revenue. 
 If the tribunal does not agree to the WRA’s request for a further appeal, the WRA may make seek permissions to make a further appeal under sections 11(4)(b) (to the Upper Tribunal) or 13(4)(b) (to another appellate court) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.Otherwise the decision of the tribunal is final.

738,738,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Reviews and appeals,TCMA/5140 Settlement agreements," The WRA and the taxpayer can enter into a settlement agreement, which can uphold, vary or cancel the original decision which is the subject of the review or appeal. 
 The effect or consequences of a settlement agreement are the same as if the tribunal had determined an appeal in relation to the matter in question by upholding, varying or cancelling the decision (whichever applies). However, a settlement agreement is not treated as a decision of the tribunal for the purposes of sections 9 and 10 (Review of decisions of First-tier and Upper Tribunals), 11 (Right to appeal to Upper Tribunal), 12 (Proceedings on appeal to Upper Tribunal) and 13 (Right to appeal to Court of Appeal of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.) 
 The above paragraph does not apply: 
 
 where the taxpayer withdraws from the settlement agreement by notifying the WRA within 30 days from the day when they entered into the settlement agreement, or 
 where the settlement agreement is not in writing, unless the fact that an agreement was entered into, and the terms agreed, are confirmed by a notice in writing from either the WRA to the taxpayer or the taxpayer to the WRA. 
 
 A settlement agreement may not be entered into in relation to an appealable decision, if an appeal has been finally determined.

739,739,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8010 Purpose and status of this guidance," The General Anti-avoidance Rule (‘GAAR’) applies to Welsh devolved taxes. The devolved taxes are land transaction tax (‘LTT’) and landfill disposals tax (‘LDT’). The UK General Anti-Abuse Rule does not apply to the Welsh devolved taxes. 
 It should be noted that whilst there are similarities between the GAAR that operates in relation to the Welsh devolved taxes and the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule and Scottish General Anti-Avoidance Rule it contains a number of distinct differences from both these rules. It is therefore important when considering the application of the GAAR to the devolved taxes that taxpayers, their advisers and the WRA staff are fully aware of the legislation which is found in Part 3A of the Tax Collection and Management (Wales) Act 2016 (sections 81A to 81I), and this guidance. 
 This guidance has 3 main objectives: 
 
 to give a broad summary of what the GAAR is designed to achieve, and how the GAAR operates to achieve it 
 to help with the interpretation and application of the GAAR, by discussing its purpose, considering particular features of the GAAR and, where appropriate, illustrating that discussion by means of examples, and 
 setting out how the GAAR will be used by WRA to counteract avoidance activity 
 
 Whilst the guidance is intended to be a helpful tool for taxpayers, it cannot provide complete clarity or certainty. The GAAR is intended to catch situations or transactions that were not specifically considered or anticipated at the time of its enactment. If there is doubt as to whether a particular transaction may be caught by the GAAR, taxpayers should exercise caution and anticipate that the WRA will seek to proactively apply a wide interpretation of the GAAR. 
 Unlike the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule, this guidance is not specifically referred to in the legislation. There is no requirement akin to Section 211(2) of Finance Act (FA) 2013, which requires any court or tribunal which is considering the application of the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule to take into account the HMRC guidance. 
 It will be for the court or tribunal to decide what evidence to consider and what significance is to be given to this guidance in any proceedings in relation to the application of the GAAR. 
 The guidance is tailored to the Welsh devolved taxes. The partial devolution of income tax to Wales will not be covered by the GAAR as income tax will remain under the administration of HMRC and the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule will continue to apply. 
 Guidance is also provided in relation to the procedural aspects of the operation of the GAAR. This includes the making, by the WRA, of proposed and final counteraction notices and how adjustments to bring any tax to be assessed under the GAAR will be effected.

740,740,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8020 What the GAAR is designed to achieve," The enacting of the GAAR by the National Assembly for Wales (‘the Assembly’) is a clear statement that no-one will be permitted to limit their liability to devolved taxes by engaging in artificial tax avoidance. 
 Rather, the Assembly has imposed a statutory limit to the extent a taxpayer can go when trying to limit their liability to tax. A taxpayer who enters into artificial tax avoidance arrangements that do not constitute a reasonable course of action may find that the GAAR is used to counter their tax planning. 
 The primary purpose of the GAAR is to provide the WRA with a robust tool to tackle artificial arrangements that create a tax advantage that the Assembly did not intend when enacting the relevant legislation. The GAAR should therefore, primarily, deter taxpayers from entering such arrangements. 
 The GAAR is not intended to stop taxpayers arranging their affairs to, for example, claim reliefs that the Assembly intends to be claimed. However, a taxpayer arranging their affairs in an artificial way to put themselves, or another taxpayer, in a position to claim a relief that would not otherwise have been available to them may find that the GAAR will be used to counteract the tax advantage gained.

741,741,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8030 Arrangements which are caught by the GAAR," The GAAR provides the WRA with a power to counteract a “tax advantage” deriving from an “artificial tax avoidance arrangement”. The 3 elements of this (“tax advantage”, “artificial” and “tax avoidance arrangements”) have been defined in the TCMA at sections 81D, 81C and 81B respectively. 
 The meaning of “tax advantage” 
 In the GAAR, a “tax advantage” can only mean one of the things listed in section 81D. These are: 
 
 the claiming of a relief or an increased relief from tax 
 the repayment of or an increased repayment of tax 
 the avoidance or the reduction of a charge to tax 
 the deferral of a payment of tax or the advancement of a repayment of tax, and 
 the avoidance of an obligation to deduct or account for tax 
 
 The meaning of “tax avoidance arrangements” 
 Section 81B(1) provides that an arrangement is a “tax avoidance arrangement” if: 
 
 “the obtaining of a tax advantage for any person is the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of a taxpayer entering into the arrangement”. 
 
 In order for a taxpayer’s affairs to potentially be counteracted by the GAAR the taxpayer must have sought to obtain an advantage for themselves or another person by, for example, paying less tax, making a claim to repayment or delaying the payment of tax. The obtaining of that advantage must have been the main or one of the main reasons for including or structuring the arrangements in the manner that resulted in the advantage. 
 The test therefore covers situations where the main purpose was the obtaining of the tax advantage and cases where the obtaining of the tax advantage was one of the main purposes. In many cases, for example in land transaction tax, the main purpose may be obtaining ownership of the land. 
 However, if arrangements are structured in such a way that they result in, for example, no or less tax being payable than would otherwise have been absent those arrangements, then the reduction of the tax liability is likely to be one of the main reasons for the arrangements being entered into. When determining whether the arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements, the tax that would have been payable (or not repayable) if the arrangements had not been entered into is an important factor. Therefore if tax would have been payable absent the arrangements, then in the absence of other evidence, this may indicate that they are tax avoidance arrangements. 
 The main, or one of the main, purposes test 
 The definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” includes cases where “the main, or one of the main, purposes” (‘main purpose test’) of entering into the arrangement is to obtain a tax advantage. 
 In applying the GAAR the WRA will give consideration to the decisions of the courts and tribunals in regard to the meaning of main purpose and one of the main purposes. 
 It should be noted that the “main purpose” test does not operate in isolation, as the tax avoidance arrangements must also be artificial. 
 Meaning of “arrangement” 
 The definition of an arrangement for the purposes of the GAAR is wide and includes (in section 81B(3)(a)) any: 
 
 transaction 
 scheme 
 action 
 operation 
 agreement 
 grant 
 understanding 
 promise 
 undertaking 
 event 
 
 The definition also includes any series of the above either of one of the list (for example, a series of transactions) or in combination with one or more of the other listed arrangements. 
 The GAAR applies to all Welsh devolved taxes, the definition of “arrangement” therefore ensures that avoidance arrangements involving landfill disposals tax (which might involve a particular “event” or an individual undertaking a particular “action” or “operation”) are also within the scope of the GAAR. 
 Meaning of “artificial” 
 A tax avoidance arrangement will be “artificial” if entering into it or carrying it out is not a reasonable course of action in relation to the legislative provisions applying to the arrangements. 
 Section 81C(2) sets out 2 of the factors which might be taken into account when deciding whether an arrangement is artificial: 
 
 Does the arrangement have any “genuine economic or commercial substance”? 
 Having regard to whether the arrangement has “any genuine economic or commercial substance” enables the WRA (and therefore the taxpayer and ultimately any tribunal or court) to consider the reasons behind the structure of the transaction. Other targeted anti-avoidance rules (“TAARs”) on the UK statute book already operate by reference to whether an arrangement has a “genuine commercial substance” (For example, sections 455 and 446A of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and regulation 4(2) of the Real Estate Investment Trusts (Prescribed Arrangements) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3315)), or “bona fide commercial purpose” and practitioners and the judiciary will be familiar with undertaking an assessment as to whether an arrangement has “commercial substance” (For example, paragraphs 2(4A) and 8(5B). Schedule 7 of the Finance Act 2003 and section 734 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, and the Supreme Court judgment in UBS AG v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2016] UKSC 13). The WRA will give consideration to decisions of the courts and tribunals on the meaning of the tests where the wording is identical or similar to the wording in the GAAR. 
 The question of whether an arrangement has any “economic” or “commercial” substance will be one of fact, and it will be for the taxpayer when completing their return to decide whether there was any economic or commercial substance behind the arrangement and the structure created. 
 In many cases, the commercial or economic substance of an arrangement will be clearly apparent. For example, in a case where the buyer of land can purchase that land directly in a simple A-B transaction, the taxpayer will achieve their economic and commercial aim (of owning the land) and will not have entered into any arrangements that could be considered artificial or lacking in genuine economic or commercial substance. However, where the buyer enters into a more convoluted, and a more costly (except for any tax advantage), way to obtain the land, it is an indicator that the arrangement may lack genuine commercial substance. This is because, absent the tax advantage, it is reasonable to argue that the buyer would not have incurred that additional cost having regard to the economic and commercial objectives of acquiring the land. 
 The rule looks at the “economic” substance, for example, the acquisition of a plot of land of historical importance by a charity may be motivated by that charity’s desire to further its charitable objectives and protect the land in question, rather than for commercial reasons. Furthermore, in land transaction tax some of the reliefs relating to relief for certain transactions relating to social housing (Schedule 14) are likely to have economic substance (home ownership achieved through the giving of consideration for the homer) rather than commercial substance. 
 
 Does the arrangement result in an amount of tax chargeable that was not the anticipated result of the relevant provisions when enacted? 
 The National Assembly for Wales, when passing tax legislation, will have expected that tax will be paid, and reliefs claimed, in accordance with the intention of the legislation. If there are circumstances where the taxpayer, for example, claims relief that results in a lower amount of tax than would have been paid absent the arrangements then it is possible that those arrangements do not result in the anticipated amount of tax being paid. 
 Therefore, if a person is able, as a result of the arrangements, to claim a relief which it was not anticipated they should be able to claim, perhaps as a result of convoluted arrangements, then the GAAR provisions may be engaged. The GAAR is independent of the other anti-avoidance rules, and may be used to challenge an artificial arrangement which was itself contrived to exploit a defect, or perceived defect, in the other anti-avoidance rules. 
 
 
 It is important to note that there may be other relevant factors, but this will depend on the nature and circumstances of the arrangement. Each case will need to be considered on its facts.

742,742,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8040 Generally prevailing practice," Section 81C(3) is designed to provide taxpayers with a ‘shield’ against any claim by the WRA that an arrangement is artificial in cases where the arrangement is consistent with generally prevailing practice, and that practice had been accepted by the WRA. This rule is a means of providing additional protection to taxpayers: it would be wrong for the WRA to attempt to recover tax that has been avoided if the WRA had previously indicated that the arrangement was acceptable. 
 The generally prevailing practice rule provided in section 81C(3) provides an absolute bar against an arrangement being classed as “artificial” in the context of the GAAR. 
 However, a key point is that the generally prevailing practice must have been something that the WRA is aware of and has indicated that it accepts that the arrangements fall outside the scope of the GAAR. The WRA will have regard to case law that indicates what constitutes generally prevailing practice, such as it not including common misunderstandings of the application of the law. Furthermore, if a set of arrangements that obtains a tax advantage is considered by taxpayers or advisers to be generally prevailing practice, it will not be generally prevailing practice affording taxpayers protection under section 81C(3) if the WRA is not aware of the practice or is aware but has not indicated that it accepts that practice in writing.

743,743,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8050 Is the Welsh GAAR wider than the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule?," It is not considered that the Welsh GAAR is substantively wider than the UK General Anti-Abuse Rule. Apart from the different terminology “artificial” and “abusive”, the key difference between the Welsh GAARs as compared to the UK General Anti-Avoidance Rule is the “double-reasonableness” test. In common with the Scottish General Anti Avoidance Rule, the GAAR does not adopt this rule because, as a public authority, the WRA will be bound by normal public law principles, including the requirement to act reasonably. A statutory bar on the WRA counteracting an arrangement, where it unreasonably considers that the arrangement is caught by the GAAR is unnecessary.

744,744,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8060 The GAAR and WRA tax opinions," Where a taxpayer obtains a tax opinion from the WRA on the operation of the devolved taxes in accordance with the rules at  WRA Tax Opinions Service(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority-tax-opinion-service)  then they should be able to rely upon the WRA view of the operation of the legislation based on the information that the taxpayer has provided. 
 The WRA will not provide a tax opinion on the application of the GAAR. If a request for a tax opinion references the application of the GAAR to a transaction we will disregard this element of the request in our response and set out our opinion on the tax consequences of the specific circumstances or transactions in the absence of the GAAR. 
 Furthermore, a taxpayer will not be able to rely on a WRA tax opinion where a view is sought in relation to one part of an arrangement, or in relation to one arrangement that is linked to other arrangements, which is intended or might be expected to achieve the avoidance of tax. In requesting an opinion a taxpayer must provide the full details of their transaction. 
 The Welsh Revenue Authority(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority)(https://www.gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) is committed to helping taxpayers pay the right amount of tax, at the right time. If a taxpayer has entered into an arrangement or is considering doing so and a devolved tax advantage might be expected to be a main benefit, we will provide an opinion on the technical aspects of that arrangement. We will not however give a view on whether it amounts to the avoidance of a devolved tax. 
 The WRA will not provide tax planning advice, nor opinions on speculative, hypothetical or “what if” requests. 
A taxpayer cannot therefore rely on a tax opinion in respect of the application of the GAAR to a transaction. It remains the responsibility of the taxpayer to self- assess the transaction in respect of the GAAR. After a return has been filed, where appropriate the WRA may seek to apply the GAAR to the transaction, which could change the tax position. 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1 – GAAR does not apply - Extension of a long lease 
 
 
   
 A Ltd has leased a property to B Ltd, a connected person. B Ltd wishes to lengthen the lease (to 35 years) which is assumed to have a further term of 20 years. A Ltd could agree that in consideration of A Ltd accepting B Ltd’s surrender (and B Ltd’s agreement that it will take a lease from A Ltd) that A Ltd will grant B Ltd a new 35 year lease. A Ltd and B Ltd take tax advice and decide instead that A Ltd will grant a 15 year reversionary lease to B Ltd (that is, a 15 year lease which commences when B Ltd’s lease expires in 20 years’ time). 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd agrees to grant a reversionary lease to B Ltd. The lease terms (apart from the commencement date) could be the same or A Ltd could choose to charge a higher rent under the new lease than it currently charges under the existing lease. 
 Accordingly, B Ltd holds 2 consecutive leases from A Ltd, one for 20 years and the 2nd for 15 years. 
 The relevant tax provisions 
 Sections 18 and 22, paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 and paras 7 and 17 Schedule 6. 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The only LTT liability is on the rent payable under the new lease for the new term of 15 years. 
 Had the transaction been carried out by B Ltd surrendering to A Ltd and A Ltd granting a new lease for 35 years then the taxpayer would assert: 
 
 Para 17 Schedule 6 has the effect that the value of B Ltd’s existing lease which B Ltd surrenders is not consideration (a non-monetary premium) for the grant of the new lease by A Ltd and that the value of A Ltd’s promise to grant a new lease to B Ltd is not consideration for the surrender of B Ltd’s old lease.  
 If the old lease had attracted LTT (or SDLT as provided in regulation 9 of the Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018) then it would only be due on the additional rent under the new lease compared with the amount paid under the old lease (if the old lease had attracted stamp duty no ’overlap relief’ would be available so that LTT would be due on 35 years rent). 
 
 As A Ltd and B Ltd are connected persons the consideration is not less than the market value and that the specific provision in paragraph 17 (providing that the new lease is not chargeable consideration for the surrender of the old lease and the value of the old lease does not constitute chargeable consideration for the new lease) has no effect. Furthermore, as para 7(2) Schedule 6 (“for the purpose of this Act”) means that the rent is taken to be reduced by the operation of paragraph 7, that is, LTT is charged on rent as reduced by any overlap relief. 
 The GAAR analysis 
 Are the substantive results of the arrangements consistent with any principles on which the relevant tax provisions are based (whether express or implied) and the policy objectives of those provisions? 
 The LTT provisions are designed to charge transactions where interests in land are acquired, whether by grant, transfer or surrender; and to impose LTT on the consideration provided for the grant or assignment of leases. 
 For the rent, it could be said that by structuring the new lease as a reversionary lease, LTT on the new lease is reduced as compared with the LTT that would have been payable under a new 35 year lease where the old lease had attracted stamp duty. 
 The taxpayer could argue that it has a choice under land law operating in Wales whether to surrender and obtain a re-grant of a 35 year lease or retain the old lease and obtain a new 15 year lease. 
 The decision whether to surrender and re-grant, while it could be said that the policy objective is to impose LTT at a minimum by reference to market values where transactions are between connected persons, as a general rule (such as section 22) is subject to any specific statutory provision also dealing with consideration. 
 A reasonable view of these transactions is that they are consistent with policy and principles. 
 Do the means of achieving the substantive tax results involve one or more artificial arrangements? 
 
 Surrenders and re-grants, and the grant of reversionary leases as part of portfolio management, are not artificial steps 
 
 Are the arrangements intended to exploit any shortcomings in the relevant tax provisions? 
 
 No 
 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are not such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Example 2 – GAAR does apply - Higher rates residential property transactions (acquisition of freehold and grant of lease to effect arrangements to avoid tax) 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to provide an example of artificial tax avoidance arrangements. 
 Background 
 The LTTA introduces higher rates of LTT for certain residential property transactions. 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd acquires an major interest in a freehold dwelling (‘A dwelling’) on a new development. On the same day as it completes its acquisition of that interest it grants a lease for 22 years to B Ltd. A Ltd and B Ltd are unconnected but have a long but not interdependent business association. They both have substantial buy-to-let portfolios. B Ltd is also acquiring a near identical dwelling (‘B dwelling’) on the new development. It times its completion of its dwelling to fall on the same day as A Ltd’s completion. On the same day it grants a lease to A Ltd for 22 years. 
 At the end of the effective date of the 4 transactions A Ltd has a 22 year lease in B dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in A dwelling, and B Ltd has a 22 year lease in A dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in B dwelling. The granting of the leases is at a peppercorn rent. However, as they are an exchange, one lease is entered into in consideration for the other, the chargeable consideration for the leases will be the market value of the leases. 
 The terms of the leases include clauses that provide that where one lease is surrendered or disposed of that the other lease must be surrendered for the same consideration as the surrender or disposal of the lease achieved. They also contain clauses that ensure the dwellings are returned in good condition. 
 The freehold dwellings cost A Ltd and B Ltd £150,000 each (tax at higher rates £4,500, tax at normal rates zero). The leases have, given the peppercorn rent, a market value for the premium of £60,000 (tax at higher rates £1,800, tax at normal rates zero). 
 A Ltd seeks to find a tenant for B dwelling and B Ltd seeks a tenant for A dwelling. 
 The relevant provisions 
 Paragraph 20(2) of Schedule 5, section 16 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The taxpayers contend that they are liable to tax on the LTT higher rates only on the purchase of the leases and not on the freehold acquisitions. This is because at the end of the effective date the acquisition is subject to a lease held by an unconnected person and that lease has an unexpired term of more than 21 years. 
 A Ltd therefore contends that it is liable to tax on the acquisition of the freehold at normal rates (zero) and on the acquisition of the lease at LTT higher rates (£1,800). B Ltd contends that its tax position is identical.  
 The GAAR analysis 
 The WRA considers that the GAAR will be triggered. The arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements as the obtaining of the tax advantage (the reduction of a charge to tax) was, at the very least, certainly one of the main reasons (and probably the main reason) for the arrangements. 
 Those arrangements are also are also artificial arrangements that lack genuine commercial substance. The acquisition of the freehold interests have genuine commercial substance, whereas the peppercorn rent leases (even when the market value of the premium is taxed as chargeable consideration) do not have commercial substance. They are risk free (in that if A Ltd is unable to let B dwelling it incurs no rent payments and has paid no premium – it is in the same position as if it had retained its unencumbered interest in A dwelling and had been unable to let that property). 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 The application of the GAAR to in this case would result in A Ltd and B Ltd being taxed on the acquisition of the freehold interest of A dwelling and B dwelling respectively (a liability to LTT of £4,500 each rather than £1,800 each). The transactions related to the leases will be ignored for LTT purposes.

 A Ltd has leased a property to B Ltd, a connected person. B Ltd wishes to lengthen the lease (to 35 years) which is assumed to have a further term of 20 years. A Ltd could agree that in consideration of A Ltd accepting B Ltd’s surrender (and B Ltd’s agreement that it will take a lease from A Ltd) that A Ltd will grant B Ltd a new 35 year lease. A Ltd and B Ltd take tax advice and decide instead that A Ltd will grant a 15 year reversionary lease to B Ltd (that is, a 15 year lease which commences when B Ltd’s lease expires in 20 years’ time). 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd agrees to grant a reversionary lease to B Ltd. The lease terms (apart from the commencement date) could be the same or A Ltd could choose to charge a higher rent under the new lease than it currently charges under the existing lease. 
 Accordingly, B Ltd holds 2 consecutive leases from A Ltd, one for 20 years and the 2nd for 15 years. 
 The relevant tax provisions 
 Sections 18 and 22, paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 and paras 7 and 17 Schedule 6. 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The only LTT liability is on the rent payable under the new lease for the new term of 15 years. 
 Had the transaction been carried out by B Ltd surrendering to A Ltd and A Ltd granting a new lease for 35 years then the taxpayer would assert: 
 
 Para 17 Schedule 6 has the effect that the value of B Ltd’s existing lease which B Ltd surrenders is not consideration (a non-monetary premium) for the grant of the new lease by A Ltd and that the value of A Ltd’s promise to grant a new lease to B Ltd is not consideration for the surrender of B Ltd’s old lease.  
 If the old lease had attracted LTT (or SDLT as provided in regulation 9 of the Land Transaction Tax (Transitional Provisions) (Wales) Regulations 2018) then it would only be due on the additional rent under the new lease compared with the amount paid under the old lease (if the old lease had attracted stamp duty no ’overlap relief’ would be available so that LTT would be due on 35 years rent). 
 
 As A Ltd and B Ltd are connected persons the consideration is not less than the market value and that the specific provision in paragraph 17 (providing that the new lease is not chargeable consideration for the surrender of the old lease and the value of the old lease does not constitute chargeable consideration for the new lease) has no effect. Furthermore, as para 7(2) Schedule 6 (“for the purpose of this Act”) means that the rent is taken to be reduced by the operation of paragraph 7, that is, LTT is charged on rent as reduced by any overlap relief. 
 The GAAR analysis 
 Are the substantive results of the arrangements consistent with any principles on which the relevant tax provisions are based (whether express or implied) and the policy objectives of those provisions? 
 The LTT provisions are designed to charge transactions where interests in land are acquired, whether by grant, transfer or surrender; and to impose LTT on the consideration provided for the grant or assignment of leases. 
 For the rent, it could be said that by structuring the new lease as a reversionary lease, LTT on the new lease is reduced as compared with the LTT that would have been payable under a new 35 year lease where the old lease had attracted stamp duty. 
 The taxpayer could argue that it has a choice under land law operating in Wales whether to surrender and obtain a re-grant of a 35 year lease or retain the old lease and obtain a new 15 year lease. 
 The decision whether to surrender and re-grant, while it could be said that the policy objective is to impose LTT at a minimum by reference to market values where transactions are between connected persons, as a general rule (such as section 22) is subject to any specific statutory provision also dealing with consideration. 
 A reasonable view of these transactions is that they are consistent with policy and principles. 
 Do the means of achieving the substantive tax results involve one or more artificial arrangements? 
 
 Surrenders and re-grants, and the grant of reversionary leases as part of portfolio management, are not artificial steps 
 
 Are the arrangements intended to exploit any shortcomings in the relevant tax provisions? 
 
 No 
 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are not such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 
 Example 2 – GAAR does apply - Higher rates residential property transactions (acquisition of freehold and grant of lease to effect arrangements to avoid tax) 
 
 
   
 This example is intended to provide an example of artificial tax avoidance arrangements. 
 Background 
 The LTTA introduces higher rates of LTT for certain residential property transactions. 
 The arrangements 
 A Ltd acquires an major interest in a freehold dwelling (‘A dwelling’) on a new development. On the same day as it completes its acquisition of that interest it grants a lease for 22 years to B Ltd. A Ltd and B Ltd are unconnected but have a long but not interdependent business association. They both have substantial buy-to-let portfolios. B Ltd is also acquiring a near identical dwelling (‘B dwelling’) on the new development. It times its completion of its dwelling to fall on the same day as A Ltd’s completion. On the same day it grants a lease to A Ltd for 22 years. 
 At the end of the effective date of the 4 transactions A Ltd has a 22 year lease in B dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in A dwelling, and B Ltd has a 22 year lease in A dwelling, and a reversionary freehold interest in B dwelling. The granting of the leases is at a peppercorn rent. However, as they are an exchange, one lease is entered into in consideration for the other, the chargeable consideration for the leases will be the market value of the leases. 
 The terms of the leases include clauses that provide that where one lease is surrendered or disposed of that the other lease must be surrendered for the same consideration as the surrender or disposal of the lease achieved. They also contain clauses that ensure the dwellings are returned in good condition. 
 The freehold dwellings cost A Ltd and B Ltd £150,000 each (tax at higher rates £4,500, tax at normal rates zero). The leases have, given the peppercorn rent, a market value for the premium of £60,000 (tax at higher rates £1,800, tax at normal rates zero). 
 A Ltd seeks to find a tenant for B dwelling and B Ltd seeks a tenant for A dwelling. 
 The relevant provisions 
 Paragraph 20(2) of Schedule 5, section 16 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 
 The taxpayer’s tax analysis 
 The taxpayers contend that they are liable to tax on the LTT higher rates only on the purchase of the leases and not on the freehold acquisitions. This is because at the end of the effective date the acquisition is subject to a lease held by an unconnected person and that lease has an unexpired term of more than 21 years. 
 A Ltd therefore contends that it is liable to tax on the acquisition of the freehold at normal rates (zero) and on the acquisition of the lease at LTT higher rates (£1,800). B Ltd contends that its tax position is identical.  
 The GAAR analysis 
 The WRA considers that the GAAR will be triggered. The arrangements are tax avoidance arrangements as the obtaining of the tax advantage (the reduction of a charge to tax) was, at the very least, certainly one of the main reasons (and probably the main reason) for the arrangements. 
 Those arrangements are also are also artificial arrangements that lack genuine commercial substance. The acquisition of the freehold interests have genuine commercial substance, whereas the peppercorn rent leases (even when the market value of the premium is taxed as chargeable consideration) do not have commercial substance. They are risk free (in that if A Ltd is unable to let B dwelling it incurs no rent payments and has paid no premium – it is in the same position as if it had retained its unencumbered interest in A dwelling and had been unable to let that property). 
 Conclusion 
 On the facts, the arrangements are such that the WRA would seek to apply the GAAR. 
 The application of the GAAR to in this case would result in A Ltd and B Ltd being taxed on the acquisition of the freehold interest of A dwelling and B dwelling respectively (a liability to LTT of £4,500 each rather than £1,800 each). The transactions related to the leases will be ignored for LTT purposes.

745,745,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8070 The GAAR and other devolved tax rules," The GAAR is designed to counteract tax advantages which arise as a result of the artificial tax avoidance arrangements that have been used by the taxpayer. The WRA must therefore conclude that the arrangements are artificial before taking action to counteract the tax advantage using the GAAR. 
 It is likely that a taxpayer will already be under enquiry before the WRA will advance an argument that the taxpayer has potentially triggered the GAAR. The WRA, prior to advancing arguments under the GAAR, may have already advanced arguments under other areas of the devolved taxation legislation to challenge the tax result the taxpayer has sought to achieve. Therefore, in such enquiries the WRA may run a number of arguments with different tax results and, potentially, with different taxpayers being liable to the tax (depending upon the arrangements in question). 
 There may be some arrangements which appear to be so clearly artificial that it would be appropriate for the WRA to commence its enquiry with the intention of demonstrating that the GAAR has been triggered. This may be the case where evidence emerges that a taxpayer has entered into the same arrangements as another taxpayer (for example if an avoidance scheme has been mass marketed) and a GAAR challenge is already running in that other enquiry. 
 Whilst multiple arguments based on other areas of the devolved tax legislation may be possible, the WRA can choose to use only a GAAR challenge. A taxpayer cannot object to the use of the GAAR simply because other means available to the WRA to challenge the artificial arrangement have not been used. 
 Other statutory provisions relating to devolved taxes contain specific anti-avoidance rules. Some of these are known as targeted anti-avoidance rules (TAARs), while others may take the form of less explicit anti-avoidance protection. In relation to LTT, the most significant is the rule at section 31 LTTA which is targeted to stop claims using tax avoidance arrangements to access the relief. 
 The GAAR is independent of the other anti-avoidance rules, and it might be used to challenge an artificial arrangement which was itself contrived to exploit a defect, or perceived defect, in the other anti-avoidance rules.

746,746,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8080 Commencement of the GAAR and the Transitional rule," The GAAR will only apply to those tax avoidance arrangements entered into on or after the date on which the GAAR came into force. This is 1 April 2018. 
 This means that the WRA cannot consider or have regard to any arrangements entered into before that date to make a challenge using the GAAR. However, other challenges using other parts of the Welsh Taxes Acts may still be possible. 
 Conversely, a taxpayer will be able to have regard and make reference to arrangements entered into before 1 April 2018 if that will assist the taxpayer in showing that the tax avoidance arrangements were not artificial. 
 ",https://www.gov.wales/tax-collection-and-management-wales-act-2016-general-anti-avoidance-rule-technical-guidance
747,747,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8090 How will the WRA counteract an advantage?," If the WRA considers that an arrangement is artificial and that the GAAR is to be used to counteract the tax avoidance arrangements, whether alone or together with other challenges to the arrangements (for example a specific TAAR), then the WRA must follow the procedures set out in the GAAR legislation.  
 Section 81E TCMA 2016 sets out that any adjustment made by the WRA must be just and reasonable to counteract the tax advantage. In most cases this should be a relatively straightforward task to decide what adjustments need to be made to achieve that just and reasonable result. For example, in LTT where a taxpayer has entered into tax avoidance arrangements that have reduced their liability to zero, where consideration given for the subject matter of the land transaction would have resulted in a liability of £100,000, then the £100,000 liability will be sought through the counteraction notice. 
 However, if the tax avoidance arrangements were complicated then there may be a number of points at which the GAAR could result in a tax charge. If the WRA were to seek the tax charge at each point the tax result could be greater than if the artificial arrangements had not been entered in to at all. Using the LTT example in the previous paragraph if the tax avoidance arrangements resulted in multiple transactions (each of which the taxpayer contended resulted in a zero liability) then, had the taxpayer not entered in to the arrangements and had simply acquired the property from the seller directly, then the WRA will not seek tax for each and every transaction arising from the arrangements but will seek to tax the most likely or appropriate alternative transaction. That alternative transaction or arrangement may not be the one that would result in the highest tax charge. 
 In order to protect its position, the WRA may make more than one counteraction, with associated assessments and closure notices. This is because, in the event of appeal, the WRA may wish to present the tribunal with alternative tax consequences and, even, potentially different persons bearing the liability to tax. Ultimately the WRA must ensure that the adjustments do not involve any element of double taxation (whether for the taxpayer who carried out the artificial transaction(s), or when taking account of the tax liabilities of other persons).

748,748,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8100 The GAAR and self-assessed tax regimes," The devolved taxes are self-assessed taxes; the taxpayer assesses and informs the WRA what their tax liability is through a return. The GAAR forms part of the legislative framework for the devolved taxes. As the devolved taxes operate on a basis of self-assessment, taxpayers are required to take the provisions of the GAAR into account when completing their tax returns.

749,749,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8110 The GAAR and penalties," The Welsh Taxes Acts do not include any specific provisions imposing penalties counteracted by the GAAR. However, under the general principles of self-assessment, a taxpayer has a duty to submit a correct tax return. 
 Therefore, if a taxpayer considers that they have entered into arrangements that are artificial, then their tax return must make an appropriate adjustment to reflect the fact that the GAAR is applicable. Failure to make an appropriate adjustment could mean the taxpayer has committed an offence by submitting a return containing inaccuracies and they are liable to a penalty on the inaccuracy. 
 A taxpayer who is uncertain whether an arrangement is within the scope of the GAAR may wish to contact the WRA at the time the return is submitted, indicating the uncertainty. In such circumstances, the taxpayer is advised to make a full disclosure of all the relevant facts. Whilst penalties for inaccuracies may still be due, depending upon the specific facts of the tax avoidance arrangements, the full disclosure of the facts may provide grounds for mitigation of any penalty chargeable. The penalty will be based on the potential lost revenue as a result of the tax avoidance arrangements. 
 In the event that tax avoidance arrangements have been implemented incorrectly, so that the tax advantage that was sought by entering into the arrangements could not been achieved, then penalties for inaccuracies in the return will, where appropriate, be sought.

750,750,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8120 Counteraction notices," The WRA must follow the procedure set out in sections 81E to 81G when using the GAAR to counteract tax avoidance arrangements. In many enquiries the use of the GAAR may be one of a number of arguments advanced by the WRA to challenge the taxpayer’s self-assessment. Furthermore, the decision to advance GAAR arguments may come at a point in an enquiry when the WRA has already made an assessment based on technical arguments rather than the GAAR. 
 Whilst there is a need to use the counteraction notice procedure, the tax charged will continue to be assessed through a closure notice where there is an open enquiry, or by a WRA assessment. It is therefore important that when making the closure notice that all alternative tax results are fully set out. It is also possible, when considering making an assessment or a determination, for the WRA to consider whether the taxpayer may have entered into tax avoidance arrangements that the WRA may want to challenge using the GAAR.

751,751,Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / General anti-avoidance rule,TCMA/8130 Proposed counteraction notice," The WRA must issue the taxpayer with a proposed counteraction notice which states that the WRA considers a tax advantage to have arisen from an artificial tax avoidance arrangement and that the tax advantage is to be counteracted by an adjustment effected either by assessment or a closure notice. 
 The proposed counteraction notice must: 
 
 specify the tax avoidance arrangement and the tax advantage, 
 explain why the WRA considers that a tax advantage has arisen from the artificial tax avoidance arrangement, 
 set out the WRA proposed adjustments to counteract the tax advantage, and 
 specify the amount that the taxpayer will be required to pay in accordance with the proposed assessment (this should include tax arising under the GAAR counteraction and any other tax arising from other the WRA action, for example challenges to other aspects of the taxpayers affairs) 
 
 The proposed counteraction notice must also inform the taxpayer: 
 
 that a final counteraction notice will be issued after the expiry of a period of 45 days from the date of issue of the proposed counteraction notice, 
 that the taxpayer can ask the WRA to consider extending that 45 day period, and 
 that the taxpayer may make written representations at anytime in that 45 day (or as extended) period 
 
 The provision of the 45 day period for the taxpayer to make written representations is to enable the taxpayer to challenge the WRA conclusions that an artificial tax avoidance arrangement has given rise to a tax advantage. Following the expiry of that period, and if the WRA’s view has not been altered by the taxpayers written representations, then the WRA issue a final counteraction notice.

 The WRA, where it has issued a proposed counteraction notice, must issue a final counteraction notice stating whether the tax advantage arising from the tax avoidance arrangement is to be counteracted by either a closure notice or a WRA assessment. This means that even where the WRA accepts the taxpayer’s return is not subject to the GAAR (perhaps because of the written representations) the WRA must issue a final counteraction notice confirming that action under the GAAR is not to be pursued. 
 If the WRA does consider that the tax advantage should be counteracted by the GAAR then the final counteraction notice must also: 
 
 specify the adjustment required to give effect to the counteraction, 
 set out the amendment necessary, where the adjustment relates to a return that is under enquiry, to be included in the closure notice, 
 where the tax advantage is not to be counteracted through a closure notice, an assessment must be made at the same time as issuing the notice, or an assessment already made must be identified as giving effect to the counteraction, and 
 specify the amount of tax that must be paid as a result of the amendment required or assessment

This is because the notices themselves do not create a tax liability. The closure notice or the assessment issued to give effect to the counteraction notice are reviewable and appealable decisions.

 In Inland Revenue Commissions v Brebner ([1967] 2 W.L.R. 1001), the Court of Appeal considered whether a tax advantage was “one of the main objects” of entering into an arrangement:
	 
 “… when the question of carrying out a genuine commercial transaction, as this was, is reviewed, the fact that there are two ways of carrying it out - one by paying the maximum amount of tax, the other by paying no, or much less, tax - it would be quite wrong, as a necessary consequence, to draw the inference that, in adopting the latter course, one of the main objects is, for the purposes of the section, avoidance of tax. No commercial man in his senses is going to carry out a commercial transaction except upon the footing of paying the smallest amount of tax that he can. The question whether in fact one of the main objects was to avoid tax is one for the Special Commissioners to decide upon a consideration of all the relevant evidence before them and the proper inferences to be drawn from that evidence.” [at p 718-9] 
 
 
 In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Trustees of the Sema Group Pension Scheme ([2002] EWHC 94 (Ch). The extract was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in [2002] EWCA Civ. 1857 at paragraph 119.), the High Court was asked to consider whether “one of the main objects” of entering into an arrangement was to obtain a tax advantage:
	 
 “The tax advantage may not be a relevant factor in the decision to purchase or sell or in the decision to purchase or sell at a particular price. Obviously if the tax advantage is mere “icing on the cake” it will not constitute a main object. Nor will it necessarily do so merely because it is a feature of the transaction or a relevant factor in the decision to buy or sell. The statutory criterion is that the tax advantage shall be more than relevant or indeed an object; it must be a main object.” [at para. 53] 
 
 
 More recently, in Versteegh Ltd and others v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2013] UKFTT 642 (TC)) the First-tier Tribunal whether a tax advantage was a “main purpose or one of the main purposes” of the taxpayer entering into the arrangement:
	 
 “In the same way that the mere presence of a commercial purpose cannot rule out the existence of tax avoidance as being a main purposes, the mere existence of a tax advantage, known to the taxpayer, does not on its own render the obtaining of that advantage a main purpose. All the authorities point to the question being one of degree and significance to the taxpayer, and that the question is one of fact for the tribunal, having regard to all the circumstances.” [at para. 158] 
 
 
 In UBS AG v Commissioners for Revenue and Customs ([2016] UKSC 13), the Supreme Court considered whether to interpret provisions in income tax legislation to lead to tax-free bonuses awarded by various banks in 2004 in such a way to enable them to be regarded as a means of avoiding income tax:
	 
 “There is nothing in the background to suggest that Parliament intended that [the provisions allowing for the award of tax-free bonuses] should also apply to transactions having no connection to the real world of business, where a restrictive condition was deliberately contrived with no business or commercial purpose but solely in order to take advantage of the exemption.” [para 78]

756,756,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1010 Filing date," The ‘filing date’ is the date by which a tax return needs to be submitted to the WRA. For tax returns completed online, the return is filed on the day it is submitted. If a paper return is posted, the return is filed on the date it is received by the WRA.

757,757,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1020 Amending a tax return," The taxpayer may amend their tax return within 12 months of the filing date by notifying the WRA.  
 An amendment made when the tax return in question is under enquiry does not take effect until the WRA issues a closure notice completing the enquiry. However, the amendment does not take effect where the WRA closure notice states it has either taken the amendment into account in reaching its conclusions, or that the WRA has concluded the amendment to be incorrect.

758,758,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1030 WRA correction of a tax return," The WRA may amend a tax return to correct an obvious error or omission. This could be an arithmetical mistake or an ‘error of principle’ such as entering a forename and surname the wrong way around.  
 The WRA will issue a notice to the taxpayer giving effect to any such corrections. The WRA cannot make a correction more than 9 months after receiving a tax return.  
 The taxpayer may reject corrections made by the WRA by notifying the WRA within 3 months of the correction being issued, or by amending the tax return within 12 months of the filing date. 
 If, as a result of a correction, an additional amount of tax is payable, the taxpayer must pay this within 30 days of the notice of correction being issued.

759,759,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1040 Giving notice of an enquiry," The WRA must notify the taxpayer if it intends to open an enquiry into a tax return (a ‘notice of enquiry’) within 12 months of the date on which a return was due to have been filed, or, if later, the day on which WRA actually it received the return (an ‘enquiry period’). If a return has been amended by the taxpayer, the enquiry period will instead be within 12 months of the date of the amendment. 
 The WRA may open an enquiry after the enquiry period if the following conditions are met: 
 
 it is a tax return in relation to a land transaction 
 a further tax return has been made in respect of the same land transaction 
 WRA has opened an enquiry into the further tax return 
 WRA believes it necessary to enquire into the earlier tax return 
 
 An enquiry cannot be opened if the return has already been the subject of a previous enquiry. However, if the WRA closes the enquiry and the taxpayer subsequently amends the return, the WRA may issue a further notice of enquiry but this enquiry will be limited to matters relating to or affected by the amendment.

760,760,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1050 Scope of enquiries," An enquiry can be in relation to anything contained, or required to be contained in a tax return, that relates to: 
 
 whether the taxpayer is liable to pay the tax, and 
 the amount of tax payable 
 
 If a notice of enquiry has been issued following an amendment to a tax return, if the WRA has previously closed an enquiry into the return, the new enquiry is limited to matters related to the amendment or matters affected by the amendment.

761,761,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1060 WRA amendment of a tax return during an enquiry," If an enquiry into a tax return is in progress and the WRA forms the opinion that: 
 
 the amount of tax payable as stated in a self-assessed tax return is lower than it should be, and 
 unless the deficit is paid immediately, there could be a loss of devolved tax 
 
 the WRA may issue a notice to the taxpayer amending the tax return to bring the additional tax into charge. 
 If the scope of an enquiry is limited to matters arising from a taxpayer amendment because a previous enquiry into the original return has been completed, then any amendment by the WRA in these circumstances can only be made if the tax deficit mentioned above is as a result of the amendment made by the taxpayer. 
 The taxpayer must pay any amount or additional amount of tax (and, where applicable, interest) chargeable as a result of a WRA amendment of a return during an enquiry within 30 days beginning with the day on which the WRA issued the notice of amendment.

762,762,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1070 Referrals to a tribunal during an enquiry," When an enquiry is in progress, any questions arising from the tax return can be referred to an appropriate tribunal for determination, providing that the WRA and the taxpayer agree. More than one referral can be made in relation to an enquiry and the taxpayer may withdraw a referral at any time. 
 While proceedings on a referral are in progress (that is, before a determination is made or a referral has been made and not withdrawn), the WRA cannot issue a closure notice and the taxpayer cannot make an application to give a closure notice. 
 A determination of a referred matter by the tribunal is binding on the taxpayer and the WRA in the same way and to the same extent as a decision on a preliminary plea in an appeal. A preliminary plea is a plea-in-law that raises a legal issue that does not relate to the merits of the proceedings but if sustained, could result in the proceedings (or part of them) being dismissed. 
 The WRA must take the determination into account both in reaching its conclusions on the enquiry and in formulating any amendments to the tax return that may be required to give effect to these conclusions. 
 The question that has been determined may not be reopened on an appeal unless it had been determined as a preliminary plea (see above) in that appeal.

763,763,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1080 Completion of an enquiry," An enquiry is completed when the WRA issues the taxpayer with a ‘closure notice’ stating that the enquiry is complete and the conclusions from the enquiry. 
 The closure notice must either state that: 
 
 in WRA’s opinion, no amendments are required to the tax return; or 
 in WRA’s opinion an amendment is required and it will make the necessary amendments to the tax return to give effect to its conclusions 
 
 If the closure notice issued by the WRA amends a tax return, the taxpayer cannot then make their own amendments, even if the time limit for normally being able to do so has not expired. If the taxpayer disagrees with the conclusions in the closure notice, they may request a review of the decision by the WRA or appeal to the tribunal. Full guidance on reviews and appeals is available at TCMA/5000. 
 The taxpayer must pay any amount or additional amount of tax (and, where applicable, interest) payable as a result of a WRA amendment within 30 days, beginning with the date on which the notice of the amendment was issued. 
 The taxpayer can apply to the tribunal for a direction that the WRA must give a closure notice within a specified period (for example, if it is felt the WRA is taking too long to complete the enquiry). The tribunal must give this direction unless it is satisfied that the WRA has reasonable grounds for not issuing the closure notice within that period.

764,764,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1090 WRA Determinations," If the WRA believes that the taxpayer is liable to pay tax and they have not filed a tax return by the relevant filing date (see TCMA/1010) a ‘WRA determination’ may be made of the amount of tax it believes is chargeable. 
 The WRA must notify the taxpayer of the determination and they must pay the tax within 30 days of the notice being issued. 
 The WRA may not make a determination more than 4 years after the relevant filing date. The relevant filing date is the date by which the WRA believes the return was required to be made. 
 WRA determination superseded by tax return 
 If the taxpayer submits a tax return after receiving notice of a WRA determination, the return supersedes the determination. 
 This must be submitted by the later of either: 
 
 4 years after the WRA’s powers to make a determination became exercisable (that is, the relevant filing date), or 
 12 months beginning with the date the WRA determination was issued 
 
 If the taxpayer’s return is submitted whilst proceedings are underway (but are not concluded) to recover any tax charged by the WRA’s determination, then the proceedings may continue as if they were proceedings for the recovery of any tax calculated by the self-assessment which is due and payable and has not been paid.

765,765,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1100 WRA assessments," If the WRA believes that any of the following situations may apply: 
 
 an amount of devolved tax that ought to have been assessed has not been assessed 
 an assessment is or has become insufficient (that is, the WRA is of the view that the taxpayer is liable to more tax than it previously thought), or 
 any relief claimed by the taxpayer or which has been given, is or has become excessive 
 
 then the WRA may make an assessment of the amount, or additional amount of tax that in its view the taxpayer should be charged. 
 The WRA can also make an assessment (also known as a ‘WRA assessment’) against any amount of tax and associated interest which has (but should not have) been repaid to the taxpayer. The WRA can recover this amount in the same manner as if it were unpaid tax.

766,766,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1110 Conditions for making a WRA assessment," A WRA assessment may only be made in the following circumstances: 
 
 when any of the situations described in TCMA/1100 were brought about carelessly or deliberately by the taxpayer, a person acting on the taxpayer’s behalf, or a partner in the same partnership as the taxpayer 
 the WRA is no longer entitled to issue an enquiry notice or it has completed an enquiry into a tax return and it could not have reasonably been expected to have been aware that one of the situations outlined in TCMA/1100 had arisen based on the information available to it at the time 
 the WRA makes an adjustment under the general anti-avoidance rule 
 
 However, the WRA is not able to make a WRA assessment if: 
 
 any of the situations described in TCMA/1100 are attributable to a mistake in a return as to the basis on which the tax liability ought to have been calculated; and 
 the return was made on the basis of practice generally prevailing at the time the return was made 
 
 Situations brought about carelessly or deliberately 
 A situation is brought about ‘carelessly’ by the taxpayer failing to take reasonable care to avoid bringing about that situation. The taxpayer (or the person who provided the information on their behalf) will also be treated as having brought about a situation carelessly if they: 
 
 discover some time later that the information provided was inaccurate, and 
 failed to take reasonable steps to inform the WRA 
 
 ‘Deliberately’ means a situation is brought about through a deliberate action by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf, or a partner in the same partnership as the taxpayer. This includes situations arising as a result of a deliberate inaccuracy in a document given to the WRA by either the taxpayer or someone on their behalf.

767,767,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1120 Time limits for making a WRA assessment," The general rule is that the WRA can only make a WRA assessment up to 4 years after the relevant date (see TCMA/1010). The relevant date generally means the filing date, unless: 
 
 a return is made if this is after the filing date, in which case it is the date the return was made, or  
 no tax return has been made, in which case it is the date by which the WRA believes the return should have been made 
 
 However, if the WRA believes a situation described in TCMA/1100 is brought about carelessly by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf or another partner in the same partnership, it can make an assessment up to 6 years after the relevant date. 
 If the WRA believes a situation described in TCMA/1100 is brought about deliberately by the taxpayer, a person acting on their behalf or another partner in the same partnership, it can make an assessment up to 20 years after the relevant date. 
 If WRA believes the taxpayer has been repaid tax that they should not have been, it may make an assessment as long as it is within 12 months of the day on which the repayment was made to the taxpayer. 
 If the taxpayer has died, a WRA assessment must be made on the personal representatives within 4 years of the date of the death, and an assessment cannot be made in respect of a relevant date more than 6 years before the death. 
 If the taxpayer wishes to object to the making of a WRA assessment on the ground that the time limit that it has to make it has expired, they must do this by giving a notice of review or appealing against the assessment. Guidance on reviews and appeals against WRA decisions can be found at TCMA/5000.

 The taxpayer must pay the amount payable (including any penalties and interest) within 30 days beginning with the day on which the WRA assessment notice is issued.

769,769,"Tax collection and management: technical guidance / Technical guidance / Tax returns, enquiries and assessments",TCMA/1140 Duty to keep and preserve records where a tax return is required," When the taxpayer is required to make a tax return they must keep and preserve records to demonstrate that the tax return is correct and complete. Records include both paper or digital records, and supporting documentation such as accounts, books, deeds, contracts, vouchers and receipts. 
 The taxpayer must keep these records until the later of the relevant date and the day on which either an enquiry into that tax return is completed or the enquiry period ends (see TCMA/1080). 
 The ‘relevant date’ is the later of 6 years from the filing date or 6 years from the date  a taxpayer amendment to the return was made (see TCMA/1020). Alternatively, the ‘relevant date’ may be an earlier date specified by the WRA. 
 Further guidance on specific record-keeping requirements under the Landfill Disposals Tax and Land Transaction Tax is available under the relevant guidance sections.

 The relevant date is the sixth year anniversary of the date of the transaction, unless WRA specifies an earlier date.
